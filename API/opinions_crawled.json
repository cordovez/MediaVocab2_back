{"headline": "How can we save British nightlife from collapse? Look to Germany \u2013 and its football", "author": "Gilles Peterson", "teaser": "Small venues are the heart of our musical culture. Here\u2019s my two-pronged plan to keep that heart beating", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 14.22 CET", "content": "Grassroots venues are the foundation upon which the mighty British music industry has been built, fuelling the phenomenal level of talent this small island has produced. Yet while successive governments have shouted about how they are a shining demonstration of the country\u2019s creativity, the very same people have cut funding and opened the cultural sector to the most brutal market logic. Alongside government neglect, small venues across the country also face rising trade costs, pressure on disposable incomes, greedy property developers, post-pandemic changes in attitudes to communal experiences and the continuing shift towards an increasingly screen-based lifestyle.\nI cut my teeth DJing and dancing in small venues up and down the country, from my earliest experiences at Christie\u2019s, in Sutton \u2013 when I\u2019d head home after Carl Cox finished up as I had to be at school the next day \u2013 to a 10-year weekly Monday residency at Bar Rumba in Soho and many formative nights at the Hare &amp; Hounds in Birmingham. There are countless more \u2013 far too many to list them all. If it weren\u2019t for these backrooms, I would not be where I am today as a DJ. Nor would I have encountered (and still do!) those voices that push the culture forward and bring energy and positive momentum to our world.\nThe worry, of course, is that if these kinds of spaces disappear, we will end up with performances and DJ sets that all sound the same in places that all look the same, and where homogeneity becomes the status quo. The same sort of flattening of nuance is often levelled at algorithmically driven music discovery. And if this happens, we lose the joy of the unexpected find; the moment where you turn to the person next to you and laugh \u2013 what the jazz critic Whitney Balliett used to call \u201cthe sound of surprise\u201d.\nAnd that is why I think we should collectively work to preserve this special corner of our national makeup and fight against it fizzling out. The only way to do that is to open those spaces up and create access so that individuals can experience it for themselves. But to do that we also need to challenge some of the economic assumptions that govern these spaces.\nThe reality is that we live in a system where globally recognised names dominate the space and, albeit unwittingly, remove oxygen from those coming up. It is a bit like football. In the UK money has gone in at the top, resulting in the Premier League being the most lucrative in the world (with all the export value that brings); yet outside the elite clubs there is a real struggle to nurture and maintain grassroots clubs, as is often reported. Meanwhile in Germany there is a much more established practice of community ownership, with the 50+1 rule ensuring that the club\u2019s members always own a majority stake. It may be that the Bundesliga is less \u201cvaluable\u201d than the Premier League in monetary terms \u2013 but it makes it a more sustainable environment for the wider good of the game and places local communities at the heart of its financial stability.\nSo what can be done? To my mind there are two areas to focus on.\nFirst, we need to find new economic systems for funding these smaller clubs so they can thrive, not just barely survive. In an excellent piece published a couple of weeks ago by John Harris on the \u201cmagic and messy glory\u201d of Britain\u2019s nightlife, he suggested a small levy on tickets in arenas and stadiums, which could flow back to independent venues. This makes sense to me. But perhaps we could also look at models of community ownership and cooperative practices that could shore up the foundational layer of smaller venues, much like those football models from abroad. If we were to follow the lead of the German clubbing model we could also keep ticket prices and fees affordable to encourage entry \u2013 perhaps there is something to learn from this.\nSecond, we need to borrow the principles of the \u201ceach one teach one\u201d mantra of Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors \u2013 the organisation that rose up out of the 80s jazz generation with a mission to educate and elevate young musicians coming through. Without its work, the most recent UK jazz generation \u2013 think Ezra Collective, Nubya Garcia, Shabaka Hutchings, Kokoroko and many more \u2013 might not have reached the heights they have, proving yet again the importance of education, funding and deep knowledge that only the grassroots can bring.\nWith all this in mind, this year I am going to redouble my efforts to play at small UK clubs as I have been doing \u2013 places like the Golden Lion in Todmorden, Cosmic Slop in Leeds, Sub Club in Glasgow. The aim is to keep shining a light on these special places and hopefully bring in audiences old and new in a way that gives back some of what they have given me and countless others. I am also going to gather those stories and use the media at my disposal to share them more widely.\nI hope that through this journey to engage in a wider conversation about the importance of smaller venues. There will always be a section of the population drawn to the transcendental communal experience of dance and the \u201cmagic and mess\u201d of seeing live music up close and in the flesh. But these life-affirming experiences \u2013 life-defining in my case \u2013 need the places and spaces to carry them. That is why I am determined to fight for their survival. I\u2019ll hope you\u2019ll join me.\nGilles Peterson is a DJ, broadcaster and founder of Brownswood Recordings"},
{"headline": "Chumbawamba wrote Tubthumping as a working-class anthem. We won\u2019t have it stolen by the right", "author": "Boff Whalley", "teaser": "Why do populists so often use the work of artists who despise them? Because they don\u2019t have any good songs of their own", "published": "Sat 23 Mar 2024 08.00 CET", "content": "The beauty of writing a song that revolves around a universal idea is that people feel like it could be theirs: it voices the way they\u2019re feeling. The first time I heard my band Chumbawamba\u2019s hit Tubthumping played at the ground of my local football club, I was standing at the urinal in the toilet underneath the stands, pissing the afternoon away with scores of other blokes, ready for the match. I walked up to my seat and watched people singing along to what had instantly become, in that moment at least, their song.\nTubthumping belongs to the guests at the wedding who sing it in celebration. It belongs to the Italian anti-fascists who sing it in defiance on a demonstration. It belongs to cancer patients going through chemotherapy, seeing every successful bout of treatment as a personal victory. I know that all these people have taken the song as theirs, because they write to tell us. This is how songs become \u201cfolk songs\u201d: songs that belong to our shared histories, not to a single version performed by a single artist.\nThere are hundreds of songs like this, songs that feel as if they belong to us all. When we sing Fairytale of New York at Christmas, the let\u2019s-all-join-in spirit of it isn\u2019t the sole property of Shane, Kirsty and the Pogues \u2013 it\u2019s our song, too.\nBut there\u2019s a problem with these universal songs \u2013 they can be hijacked by people who clearly don\u2019t understand the spirit in which they were written, and want to use them to aggrandise themselves, or to sell ideas that aren\u2019t universal at all. It\u2019s like baking a cake and declaring to the room: \u201cHere, have a slice, the cake is for all of us!\u201d And some greedy bastard grabs five or six slices and scurries off into a dark corner, sniggering. And to stretch that analogy, the greedy bastard is the person that, noticeably, never turns up with his own cake for everyone to share.\nBecause that\u2019s the thing with songs, with literature, with art, theatre, cinema, with most of the beautiful, creative, cultural things we love \u2013 they are very rarely created by those on the political right. The bigots don\u2019t have any good songs of their own.\nWhich brings me to New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister Winston Peters and his use of Tubthumping. The man is clearly modelling himself on the recent upsurge of populist politicians, these ultra-wealthy men somehow getting to claim to be \u201cof the people\u201d. Across the globe, from Italy to Sweden and from Jair Bolsonaro to Donald Trump, these self-styled \u201coutsiders\u201d are gaining power and popularity using slogans that appeal to ordinary people, slogans that make no sense when you put them in the mouths of millionaire careerists. Their rhetoric is anti-elite, and yet they clearly and definably are the elite. Their popularity depends upon them playing at being just like you and me, the good guy at the bar who buys you a drink while you\u2019re watching the football, who tells you the reason the country is going down the drain isn\u2019t because of the multibillionaire corporate hoarding of the world\u2019s wealth but because \u2026 cue a culture-warrior rant about immigration and snowflakes and experts and \u201cI did my own research\u201d.\nLet me be clear: the song Tubthumping was written to celebrate the resilience and tenacity of working-class folk who keep fighting when the chips are down. It has nothing whatsoever in common with wealthy politicians with extremist anti-liberal agendas.\nThere have been many, many examples of rightwing populist leaders using ostensibly leftwing music to hoodwink their audiences into some kind of hypnotic self-delusion that they are \u201cof the people\u201d. The Conservative party has a history of being called out for singing and playing songs by leftwing artists at its annual party conference. From a rendition of John Lennon\u2019s Imagine in the Thatcher years (is it possible to be that oblivious to irony?) to a more recent use of M People\u2019s Moving On Up (apparently the song\u2019s co-writer, Mike Pickering, was \u201cvery angry\u201d), it\u2019s as if these careerist politicians think we won\u2019t notice that their jukebox is stuffed full of songs by artists who despise them and their ideas.\nFormer Tory prime minister David Cameron listed one of his favourite songs as the Jam\u2019s Eton Rifles which prompted the Jam\u2019s Paul Weller to retort \u201cWhich bit didn\u2019t you get? \u2026 It wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.\u201d When Cameron also admitted to liking the Smiths, guitarist Johnny Marr said simply: \u201cStop saying that you like The Smiths, no you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s as if the new breed of populist leaders think they can hide their multimillionaire \u201cman of the people\u201d contradictions behind such universally loved songs. Trump is particularly ignorant when it comes to his choice of campaign songs; he\u2019s been forced to stop using music by artists including Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, the Beatles and Elton John. Chumbawamba had to send our own \u201ccease and desist\u201d when a pre-president Trump thought he could use Tubthumping without realising we would loudly object. Which all makes it all the more obvious that, simply, the right doesn\u2019t have any good songs. That\u2019s why they keep trying to nick ours.\nBoff Whalley is a musician and writer, and the former lead guitarist of Chumbawamba"},
{"headline": "The Guardian view on Evan Gershkovich\u2019s year behind bars: Moscow should free him now", "teaser": "The Wall Street Journal correspondent is not a spy. He is a journalist, and should be released immediately from his Russian jail", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.38 CET", "content": "Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, has spent nearly a year in a Moscow prison, awaiting trial for a crime he did not commit. Mr Gershkovich was arrested last March in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and jailed on espionage charges. He is not a spy. He is a journalist, and should be released immediately. Hostage diplomacy lies behind his incarceration. As the US ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, said, Mr Gershkovich\u2019s case \u201cis not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends\u201d.\nVladimir Putin indicated in February that a prisoner exchange could lead to the release of Mr Gershkovich. There have been high-profile prisoner swaps in the past. In December 2022, Moscow traded a US basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia for a Russian arms trafficker. But a journalist\u2019s detention to secure the release of a Russian hitman would underscore Russia\u2019s retreat into a Soviet past. In 1986 an American journalist, Nicholas Daniloff, was arrested and charged with espionage. He was let go after two weeks when the US released a Soviet diplomat accused of spying. Mr\u00a0Gershkovich has been inside for nearly 12 months.\nRussia has turned away in the last decade from liberal democratic institutions such as a multiparty system, fair elections and a free press. These had taken root after the collapse of the Soviet Union but were unlikely to spring fully grown, like Athena from\u00a0the forehead of Zeus, given a history of tsarist and communist authoritarianism. After last Friday\u2019s horrific concert hall terror attacks outside Moscow,\u00a0western nations rightly stood with the Russian people. Releasing Mr Gershkovich would earn Mr\u00a0Putin\u2019s regime global goodwill when its fragility is in the spotlight.\nIn Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo jail, Mr Gershkovich has kept up his spirits by reading books and letters of support. Journalism is not a crime. Mr Gershkovich was fully accredited to report on Russia, and was doing his job when he was detained. He should never have been imprisoned. But the definition of espionage in Russia is so absurdly broad that the authorities can interpret reporting as spying. The country keeps a disproportionate number of foreign reporters behind bars. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says 12 of the global total of 17 non-local imprisoned journalists are held by Russia. Many foreign correspondents have left the country or been denied visas, and their dwindling numbers constrain those who remain even further.\nFor many Russian reporters, the profession turned deadly long ago. According to the CPJ, 43\u00a0journalists and media workers have been killed in Russia since Mr Putin came to power in 1999. Reporting that could be contrary to the state\u2019s narrative is now effectively illegal. The climate of fear has driven many Russian journalists out of the country they love.\nMany in Russia know that the defence of the free word offers inspiration to posterity. The list of\u00a0those, famous and anonymous, who struggled for\u00a0a free press in the country is a long one. Censorship will disfigure the nation\u2019s intellectual and cultural life. Mr Gershkovich understood this very well. \u201cReporting on Russia is now also a regular practice of watching people you know get locked away for years,\u201d he tweeted in 2022. Eight months later, he was in prison. His detention has been extended until 30 June, prolonging his nightmare. Moscow should set him free now.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Putin\u2019s lethally negligent failure can\u2019t be covered up. The Moscow attack leaves him weaker than ever", "author": "Simon Tisdall", "teaser": "The mask of invincibility is slipping ever further, and eventually that will matter. This debacle won\u2019t be forgiven or forgotten", "published": "Mon 25 Mar 2024 13.32 CET", "content": "Each time Vladimir Putin messes up, the same question is asked: will it make any difference? Last week\u2019s terrorist attack on the Crocus City concert hall near Moscow, which killed 137 people, is one of the bigger crises Putin has faced in his 25-year rule. There is no doubt that he, as Russia\u2019s head of state and overall chief of its security forces, bears ultimate responsibility for what was by any measure a catastrophic failure. In any normal political system, his resignation would be expected.\nThe fact this is more or less unimaginable is not necessarily a sign of Putin\u2019s strength. His dictatorship has eviscerated checks and balances within Russian society, eliminating means of independent scrutiny. Any call for him to take personal responsibility would barely be heard, let alone acted on. Yet the Russian people, while chronically misled and serially misinformed, are not stupid.\nWith blood on the streets and a nation in mourning, there\u2019s no hiding that the Putin superman myth just took a serious, bubble-bursting beating.\nThe Kremlin is estimated to have spent more than \u00a31bn on \u201cinformation management\u201d, meaning lies and propaganda, to ensure Putin\u2019s recent presidential election \u201cvictory\u201d. In addition, there was a reported 20-fold increase in state spending on internet and media. All this had a single aim: to portray Putin as an invincible, indispensable modern-day tsar who bravely protects Mother Russia from her enemies.\nYet on Friday, four gunmen comprehensively demolished that myth in an anarchic frenzy of merciless violence. The attackers were unopposed, the victims had no warning, and all of Putin\u2019s huge security apparatus \u2013 all this usurper king\u2019s horses and men \u2013 were unable to stop the butchering of defenceless citizens.\nEven in a society as tied down as Russia\u2019s, this lethally negligent failure will not be forgotten or forgiven.\nThat\u2019s on Putin. And it points to another fundamental weakness in his personal and political position: he is so out of touch, so isolated from day-to-day Russian realities, that he believes his own mendacious narratives. Despite explicit videos published online by Islamic State, which has admitted that it undertook the attack, Putin persists in blaming Ukrainian \u201cNazis\u201d. This is beyond cynical. It\u2019s borderline psychotic.\nThere is not a jot of evidence to support this deranged calumny, fiercely denied in Kyiv. Yet it\u2019s no surprise. Unsubstantiated conspiracy theories are Putin\u2019s stock in trade. The expectation is that the Kremlin, not satisfied with the recent murder of leading regime critic Alexei Navalny, will exploit the attack to further suppress domestic dissent, expand political controls, escalate the Ukraine war, even order a mass mobilisation.\nIf Putin is incapable of telling, or at least of accepting, the difference between reality and make-believe, it\u2019s because he himself squats atop an edifice of lies. His power and his presidency are based on systemic falsehoods, fed daily to a captive nation on an epic scale. The basic contract, as it is sometimes called, between Putin and the people is that he delivers security and they deliver support. Yet this is the biggest lie of all.\nPutin does not give a damn for the security and the wellbeing of ordinary Russians. At Crocus City, the big lie was cruelly exposed. As innocent people died or writhed in agony, Putin silently skulked, sulked and schemed for 19 hours about how best to dodge the blame and spin the fallout.\nHis selfish, cold-eyed insouciance has been witnessed again and again. Remember his callous attempts to ignore the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000 and the carnage he oversaw during the second siege of Grozny. Most recently it has led to the stupidest geostrategic blunder of modern times \u2013 his inept invasion of Ukraine \u2013 and resulting mass Russian casualties. He just doesn\u2019t care.\nWith Putin, it\u2019s always all about him, about his own insecurity, his need for absolute power, his delusions of revived Russian imperial grandeur. It\u2019s never about other people, let alone \u201cthe people\u201d.\nThe damage done to Russia by Putin\u2019s war and the standoff with the west, in terms of lives, treasure and reputation, is incalculable. Yet it\u2019s his abiding obsession. Everything he thinks and does appears related to it. Speaking after this month\u2019s election, he vowed yet again to make it his main focus. Why? Because, deep in his shrivelled, desiccated heart, he knows it was a terrible mistake.\nMost Russians, understandably, do not share Putin\u2019s obsession. Instead they see, with growing clarity, the harm his war does to their families, their living standards, their shrinking freedoms, their personal safety. Regime-manipulated polls are misleading. Many Russians want it to end. Their silence is not consent, nor does it signify approval. It is rooted in fear.\nPutin is vulnerable. He should have seen the terrorists\u2019 attack coming. But arrogance and complacency blinded him. When the US generously shared an explicit heads-up about an imminent plot, he dismissed it as a disinformation ploy. When the security services should have been tracking Islamist militants, they were harassing opponents, journalists and gay people on his orders.\nPutin has remade the Russian state in his own image: brutal, incompetent, ignorant, distrustful, delusional and isolated. It is fundamentally weak, as is he. Incrementally, as one calamity succeeds another, his grip slips, his authority weakens and fear of him dissipates. The Crocus City atrocity will accelerate this process. It does make a difference.\nBy helping shatter the altar screen of mythical omniscience behind which he cowers like a defrocked priest, it has forced Putin one more step down the road towards a final reckoning. It\u2019s coming, do not doubt it. It\u2019s coming.\nSimon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s foreign affairs commentator\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "The Guardian view on unpaid care: time to heed Kate and Derek\u2019s story", "teaser": "Let us hope Kate Garraway\u2019s films spark a national conversation and serious change. Society is nothing without care", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.42 CET", "content": "It is an extraordinary story, it is an ordinary tragedy. Kate Garraway\u2019s documentaries about caring for her late husband, Derek Draper, have drawn huge publicity\u00a0and millions of viewers. That is partly testimony to the celebrity of the couple \u2013 a TV presenter and a New Labour politico \u2013 but it is mostly due to the power of their story. Covid ravaged every organ in Mr Draper\u2019s body so that, in the programme aired this week, viewers saw this vibrant, sharp-witted man confined to a bed, struggling to walk or to form sentences. \u201cHis brain was his best friend,\u201d Ms Garraway remarked at one point. \u201cNow it is like his brain is his enemy.\u201d Meanwhile, the work of caring for him pushed\u00a0 her to the edge financially, psychologically, even physically. The stress was so severe that she developed heart pains that forced her to attend hospital.Even amid this intimate suffering, Ms Garraway knows there are millions of other households in similar situations \u2013 except without her profile, access to expertise or high salary. Among the programme\u2019s most moving sections are the testimonies from other carers about negotiating bureaucracy and trying to manage. They borrow money from friends and family, they go to food banks, they are \u201cjust existing\u201d. The last census from 2021 found that 5 million people provide unpaid care to a loved one.\nThat is a sizable jump from a decade ago, and carers\u2019 organisations believe the current total is higher still \u2013 perhaps 10 million \u2013 after Covid. Yet they are practically invisible in our political conversation. Ministers and economists note that nearly 3\u00a0million\u00a0people are now long-term sick and worry about the impact on our labour force \u2013 but no one asks about the people looking after them.\nNews bulletins will regularly feature stories on the desperate erosion of the NHS and the crisis in social care \u2013 yet they rarely look into the lives of wives, husbands, sons and daughters who step in where the state has failed. Provision for these people, who do some of the most important work\u00a0in Britain\u00a0today, is almost risible. Carer\u2019s allowance\u00a0is\u00a0pitifully low, while parliament has only just granted employees a week\u2019s care leave a year \u2013 unpaid, naturally. Much of this neglect is age-old sexism, predicated\u00a0on the belief that it is women who will pick up the pieces, and they don\u2019t merit much attention. This is nonsense. If voluntary carers were\u00a0to withdraw their labour tomorrow, hospitals and council services would suffer an almighty deluge. They won\u2019t, of course. In sickness and in health, runs the old wedding vow, and for many people looking after their loved ones it is an expression of just that: love. But our carers do deserve a lot more care. When the next government grapples with the crisis in the NHS, it will have to think about the care sector, and as part of that it should think about how to support unpaid carers. That means more money to social care, and funding local health and social services to do more for families in the home. It also means leaning on employers. It may be easier for an accountant, say, to negotiate more flexibility at work so that they can care for a parent; but companies that provide precarious contracts and low pay also need to step up to the mark. Let us hope that Ms Garraway\u2019s films spark a national conversation and serious change. Society is nothing without care, and we would be nowhere without our invisible army of carers."},
{"headline": "Look at streets and open spaces: where are all the children? Blame the war on play", "author": "Harriet Grant", "teaser": "It\u2019s said that youngsters are addicted to tech \u2013 but their childhoods are also being shaped by the loss of child-friendly areas", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 12.00 CET", "content": "Something has gone seriously wrong for children in the UK. On the radio, in the papers, among friends; everyone is talking about the epidemic of childhood unhappiness and anxiety. Smartphones, social media, and easy access to violent content and pornography are, of course, part of it. The rising tide of anger at under-regulated tech companies is justified. But there has been another huge change to childhood in recent years \u2013 the almost total loss of children and their play from the streets and neighbourhoods around us.\nChildren and their games, their scooters, their chalks and bouncing balls have vanished, replaced by speeding traffic and parked cars. And in losing doorstep play, children have lost the hours of exploration and physical activity that nature designed them to seek out in order to thrive. This, along with the slow erosion of time for play in schools and the austerity-driven closure of youth spaces, is profoundly changing childhood.\nI know this because for the past five years I have been reporting around the country on the war on play. It\u2019s a war that, sadly, children and the adults fighting for them are in danger of losing.\nIn 2019, I reported on the scandal of segregated playgrounds. Developers on several new-build estates in London were deliberately blocking children in social housing from shared play spaces and gardens. The segregation was appalling, and led to widespread political condemnation. But I believe it was only possible because of a much deeper injustice.\nPlay was already starting to be seen as a form of antisocial behaviour. Children and their play have been pushed off the streets and estates where they grow up, through increased traffic and a \u201cno ball games\u201d culture. With other communal spaces no longer home to crowds of children, it became easy to segregate the tiny spaces allotted for play.\nThe government cannot continue to ignore this issue. Yesterday saw the final session of a parliamentary inquiry into children, young people and the built environment. MPs on the select committee that scrutinises the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities have been hearing evidence since January on how we can plan and develop for children\u2019s needs rather than against them.\nYesterday, the inquiry questioned the minister for planning Lee Rowley. He and the government\u2019s chief planner, Joanna Averley, were pressed repeatedly on why children are missing from planning guidance. \u201cWe know they are less important than bats,\u201d pointed out the MP for Dover, Natalie Elphicke.\nBut both Averley and Rowley stuck to their guns. Children, said Rowley, do not need any further mention in planning. \u201cYou could then say disabled people need mentioning, or people from certain geographic areas.\u201d His priority, he said, is to get homes built.\nSo that\u2019s the government view: more homes, and no mention of children in planning. Rowley added, \u201cAs far as I can see, things have improved for children in terms of play provision \u2013 I can\u2019t provide evidence but I\u2019m sure they have.\u201d And with that comment, he dismissed the pages of evidence presented to the inquiry that shows the vanishing of children from their own streets in recent years \u2013 and the huge cuts to local authority play budgets.\nI gave evidence in the first session alongside Alice Ferguson, co-founder with Ingrid Skeels and Amy Rose of Playing Out, the parent-led movement that started with just one play street in Bristol and has grown into a national campaign to restore children\u2019s freedom to play out near home. It is partly down to their dogged lobbying that this inquiry is taking place. This is real people power \u2013 from play streets to parliament.\nAs thousands of homes and new developments spring up around the country, change is urgently needed. The National Planning Policy Framework mentions lorries more often than children \u2013 newts and bats are better protected than play.\nTwo other key experts in this area are the architect Dinah Bornat and writer Tim Gill. Both are advocates of child-friendly design, working with leading developers to promote doorstep play and neighbourhoods where children are free to move around, safe from traffic. But in the February evidence session, led by Labour MP Clive Betts, both made stark warnings that children are \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d in planning.\nWhat campaigners would like to see come out of this fiasco is a cross-departmental approach to consider children\u2019s needs in every area of public life. This could be led by a cabinet level minister for children.\nIn terms of planning \u2013 all new developments should be child-friendly, and existing neighbourhoods adapted with child-friendly measures.\nHousing associations and local councillors need clear guidance to refer to so that when they get complaints about play (and they do get these complaints), they can write back, stating clearly that children have a right to play near their own homes.\nAgain and again, I have seen the impact of this lack of consideration in children\u2019s lives.\nI recently wrote about residents on the Bells Gardens Estate in Peckham. Southwark council ran out of money after ripping out their playground during redevelopment, and have left the site covered in rubble.. There is no law or policy that protects play spaces in situations like these.\nJust down the road in New Cross, south London, children at Kender primary school waited several years while the Peabody housing association used their much-loved park to store building materials. While at a high-end development near Tower Bridge, I met families living in social housing flats who were sent warning letters for letting their children play in the corridors.\nIn Rhyl, one of the poorest parts of Wales, developers working for the council ripped out a much-loved playground to make way for flood defences, with local families complaining of a \u201cshameful\u201d lack of consultation. A furious local resident wrote to me \u201cthe impact of the development on local sea life was discussed more than the impact on children\u201d.\nThis extends beyond local government and developers. It seems we have turned against play across society.

{"headline": "The Guardian view on fake campaign videos: the costs of spreading false information are real", "teaser": "Labour is on course to win the London mayoralty, but this does not justify the Tories\u2019 underhand electoral tactics", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 20.24 CET", "content": "\u201cPeople who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones\u201d is a phrase that must be ringing in the ears of Tory party campaigners. They were caught spreading election disinformation against Labour\u2019s London mayor on the day that Conservative ministers accused Chinese hackers of meddling in democracy by targeting Beijing\u2019s opponents in the UK.\nThe Conservative party did delete footage of a panicked crowd at a New York subway station, which it used to falsely state that London had become a \u201ccrime capital of the world\u201d, after online criticism. But the rest of the video, with its spurious claims, remained up on Tuesday evening.\nSadiq Khan, who is standing for re-election for a third term as London mayor this May, rightly condemned the Tory video as lies and misinformation. The Conservative party is resorting to underhand tactics and fake news because it has an uninspiring candidate, Susan Hall, in London and is far behind in the polls. In January, the Tories posted an attack video on social media that misrepresented comments by Mr Khan to make it look as if he was proud to be antisemitic. The Conservative party shamefully refused to take it down.\nIt would be easy to dismiss the campaign advert as simply ludicrous. But it is also dangerous in its embrace of conspiracy-minded tropes, some of which are popular among the far right. It claims that masked Ulez enforcers, represented by a shadowy figure in a dark alleyway, are \u201cterrorising communities\u201d, and that the Ulez policy is \u201cforcing people to stay inside or go underground\u201d.\nMr Khan lives under 24-hour police protection. But the threat from disinformation is not only to him. The mayor warned that AI-generated audio which purported to capture him making incendiary remarks about Remembrance weekend last year almost caused serious disorder after it was widely shared by the far right. Fake news can \u2013 thanks to social media \u2013 spread as never before. This makes it far more dangerous. Political deepfakes, if left unchallenged, could have profound implications for journalism, voter ethics, and the quality of democracy.\nPerhaps the Tories hope that many will share their fake videos because, even though voters know the content is false, the stories stir up resentment. The Tory party has long seeded these clouds. Mr Khan is England\u2019s most high-profile Muslim politician, but he has not been defined by his faith. This has not stopped his opponent, who has falsely told fellow Tories that Jewish Londoners were frightened of Mr Khan\u2019s \u201cdivisive attitude\u201d. An investigation into Ms Hall\u2019s social media posts found she had repeatedly endorsed racially charged abuse of Labour\u2019s mayor.\nThe Tory party has also attempted to create more favourable terms for itself in London, a Labour stronghold, by changing from a preferential voting system to first past the post. This was a step back for electoral reform, but combined with voter ID requirements, it made Mr Khan\u2019s return to office harder. But so does his incumbency.\nThe social costs of virally spreading false information are real. In Europe, the posting of anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook has been correlated with violent attacks on refugees. Voters are also worse off when they believe false statements because disinformation has made it almost impossible for them to choose high-quality candidates. If we want a democratic society with policies that respond to evidence, then we must pay attention to the changing character of propaganda and develop suitable responses.\n This article was amended on 27 March 2024. An earlier version referred to \u201ca proportional voting system\u201d where \u201ca preferential voting system\u201d was meant."},
{"headline": "The Guardian view on the UN security council\u2019s ceasefire resolution: the US talks tougher on Israel", "teaser": "The Biden administration U-turned as its frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu grew. But don\u2019t expect much more", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 20.26 CET", "content": "The extent of the Biden administration\u2019s shift at the United Nations security council on Monday should not be underestimated. The US is not only by far Israel\u2019s most important ally and supplier of aid, but has provided it with stalwart diplomatic support. That it abstained instead of vetoing a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire \u2013 as it had previously done \u2013 was a major departure and leaves Israel looking extremely isolated, as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s angry reaction showed.\nYet the US has since done its best to talk down its decision, with officials insisting that there has been no change in policy and describing the resolution as non-binding. That is not the view of other security council members or the UN itself. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote that it would be \u201cunforgivable\u201d to fail to implement the resolution, which also called for the unconditional release of hostages. But Israeli airstrikes have continued.\nThe Biden administration is well aware that this war is ravaging its international standing: it is judged both complicit in the suffering in Gaza and ineffectual in its ability to restrain Israel\u2019s conduct of the war. At home, it is costing the president vital Democratic support in an election year. But more Americans believe that Israel\u2019s conduct of the war is acceptable than unacceptable, although there is a clear \u2013 and generational \u2013 divide.\nMike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, has already said that he will invite Mr Netanyahu to speak before Congress. Though many in Israel fully understand the long-term damage the Israeli prime minister has done to his country\u2019s interests as he fights for his own, there is no sign that US exasperation will speed his departure or moderate the conduct of this war.\nWhile the Biden administration treads gingerly, the humanitarian catastrophe gallops ahead in Gaza. The UN resolution stipulates a ceasefire for Ramadan \u2013 already half passed. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza\u2019s health authorities. Disease and starvation are claiming more lives as the most intense famine since the second world war takes hold \u2013 a famine entirely human-made by the destruction of so much of Gaza and the reduction of aid to a trickle. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees central to relief efforts, has said that Israel has banned it from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza.\nMr Biden has described the placing of conditions on US military aid as a \u201cworthwhile thought\u201d, but it does not appear to be one that he intends to translate into reality, though past administrations have threatened or imposed them. Recipients of arms must now give assurances that they abide by international law, but the US says it has \u201cno evidence\u201d that Israel is not in compliance. Many Democrats disagree.\nCanada has already announced that it is suspending further sales. The UK shifted from abstaining to supporting the ceasefire resolution on Monday, and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has urged the Foreign Office to publish its formal legal advice on whether Israel is breaching international law in Gaza. The reality is, however, that 99% of Israel\u2019s arms imports come from the US and Germany. Hand-wringing over humanitarian suffering is pointless when you continue to supply the weapons creating the disaster. Monday\u2019s abstention was an important symbolic moment, but it appears that little will alter unless the US makes a substantive change.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then I realised how empty I felt", "author": "Cornelia Holzbauer", "teaser": "I am still a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community, but I am happier since giving up casual encounters", "published": "Mon 4 Mar 2024 10.00 CET", "content": "Until recently, I used sexual encounters the same way others might a glass of wine after a long day, or some chocolate after a meal \u2013 before you know it, one glass can quickly turn into two or three, or a chocolate bar a day.\nHaving been single for almost five years, I found myself increasingly viewing sex as a competitive sport. It became a means to an end \u2013 an orgasm, a stress relief, a cure for boredom or loneliness. One time, I joked with my friends that I \u201cmasturbated with his body\u201d, referring to my latest conquest.\nI had been keenly aware of my casual approach towards sex for a while, but I didn\u2019t see it as a problem \u2013 I was never addicted to sex and had long been a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community. I lived by the mantra: \u201cSingles deserve intimacy, too.\u201d\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s clear that I was confusing sex with intimacy. I thought: \u201cJust because I am not in a relationship, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get to have all the sex my heart desires.\u201d But what started as an empowered \u201cI am different, I wear my nymphomania as a badge of honour\u201d journey soon snowballed into saying \u201cyes\u201d when I should have really said \u201cno\u201d.\nLast summer, I slept with a man with whom I had a rare, electric chemistry. But at 7am, after about four hours of sleep, he woke me rudely and asked me to leave \u2013 he told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep\u201d while I was there. I gathered my stuff and left, after asking him to book me an Uber. Five minutes into the ride, the driver informed me it had been cancelled. When I called the man to ask what had happened, he said I \u201chad been cold to him\u201d upon my departure. My jaw fell to the floor as I found myself stranded somewhere in Upper Manhattan.\nLast autumn, I met a man via a dating app and slept with him on the first date. After we were done \u2013 it was already 3am \u2013 he declared that he\u2019d have to go home now. Taken aback, I inquired why he wouldn\u2019t just stay over and leave in the morning. His response: \u201cSleeping next to a woman is too intimate. I\u2019d risk her falling in love with me.\u201d\nI can think of at least 10 more similar situations where I felt belittled, sidelined, slut-shamed or all of the above. But what haunts me the most is that I know I have done the same to some of my sexual partners in the past. My numbness led me to believe that this was normal behaviour in the jungle that is otherwise known as casual sex among singles.\nMy unhealthy relationship with sex came to an unceremonious end with the help of social media and a good cry. In November, inspired by the social media trend \u201cDating Wrapped\u201d, where singles post slideshow presentations summing up their year of dating, I counted the number of people I had bedded in the last year \u2013 20. I was shocked by the relatively high number, considering almost none of them had made me feel fulfilled, excited or empowered.\nMany of those encounters had been so forgettable that I had trouble recalling how I felt during or after, or found myself zoning out and thinking of something else while doing the deed. I had sometimes said \u201cyes\u201d to sleeping with someone simply because they asked, even if I wasn\u2019t attracted to them.\nLooking back, there was no one big lightbulb moment that led me to quitting casual encounters. (That might not have worked anyway; going cold turkey after years of bingeing may lead to relapses.) But sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner table surrounded by my happily married parents and my sister, her fiance and toddler, I found myself sobbing uncontrollably. The juxtaposition between my life and theirs suddenly dawned on me: \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time someone I liked held my hand or hugged me.\u201d\nI knew I needed to stop having sex with anybody other than myself \u2013 a realisation born out of pure exhaustion. I now have one rule for my current existence: I won\u2019t sleep with anyone for whom I don\u2019t have romantic feelings. It\u2019s been almost four months since I had a sexual encounter (what I used to call a \u201cdry spell\u201d), and I am feeling cleansed. The \u201csugar\u201d and \u201ctoxins\u201d are leaving my body \u2013 or rather, my mind \u2013 and I am clear and focused. It\u2019s a whole new world for me, and I feel excited, dedicating the time I used to spend recruiting my next lead, and later crying to my therapist, on my career instead.\nOf course, there are withdrawal symptoms. They usually kick in when I encounter a sex scene in a TV show or movie, or when I witness a friend going home with someone after a night out. But I am starting to realise that sex is not a numbers game and that intimacy and sex can be entirely different things.\nWhile my body is closed for business, my heart is open for romance.\nCornelia Holzbauer is a health and wellness journalist based in New York City\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "I\u2019m an Orthodox female rabbi, but I\u2019ve had to leave my unwelcoming synagogue behind", "author": "Nomi Kaltmann", "teaser": "An outdated approach to women and children keeps me from my place of worship. Without more openness, it has no future", "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 16.22 CET", "content": "I vividly recall the moment I made the decision to stop attending synagogue. It happened in 2023, a few months after welcoming my fourth child.\nMy husband and I had managed to get our children dressed and out of the door that Saturday morning \u2013 a feat any parent with small children will recognise, and we arrived in time for the synagogue\u2019s children\u2019s service, a segment lasting about 30 minutes of the larger 2.5-hour service. But our plans were quickly derailed. The children\u2019s programme concluded earlier than anticipated and the playroom was closed, under instructions from the management.\nI felt trapped. I knew that my young children would inevitably make noise, attracting disapproval from older men in the main sanctuary. Determined to find a resolution, I approached a synagogue rabbi and requested that, for that week, he would allow the play area to remain open. He agreed and I breathed a sigh of relief.\nBut a week later, the president of the synagogue called to reprimand me for being rude and demanding. Wow, I thought, frustration surging within me. I had reached my limit. If advocating for a space for children to play, allowing them to actively participate in synagogue, is deemed demanding, then I want no part in it, I thought.\nThe exchange strikes me as an accurate example of the outdated approach of too many synagogues that do not take women and children\u2019s needs into account. Although some are making efforts to improve their amenities, many older ones still have outdated facilities that overlook the necessity for adaptable spaces capable of accommodating noise, children and their caregivers.\nSome buildings lack ramps for people with disabilities or accessibility for those that require it. Breastfeeding mothers often have no access to private space to nurse their children. Instead of embracing the lively sounds of young children, indicative of continuity and a growing community, elderly men persistently shush any children who make noise. Many women I know, especially those with one or two children, have simply stopped attending because the conditions make it impossible.\nIn Orthodox Judaism, the practice of separate seating places the ladies\u2019 gallery out of sight, contributing to women feeling like mere spectators, a concern frequently overlooked by those leading the services. Hardly any Orthodox synagogues have women in leadership, and even fewer have female presidents.\nEven with awareness of these limitations, for many years, my desire to attend synagogue each week persisted. To me, showing up represented a form of leadership. Indeed, in mid-2023 I achieved a significant milestone as one of the world\u2019s first Orthodox female rabbis. While women are unable to hold leadership positions in the synagogue, I am able to teach Torah, answer questions about Jewish law and provide pastoral support on matters of faith and tradition.\nBut, despite progress in some areas, it is clear that there is still a hostility towards women, children and their needs. Synagogues, like many other religious places of worship in the 21st century, are grappling with membership challenges. A significant number of them face the issue of ageing congregations, with entire generations of young people, unlike their parents and grandparents, showing little inclination to purchase memberships. Some synagogues have had to sell their buildings, other congregations have merged and many are desperate to fill their pews on a weekly basis.\nI live in Melbourne but this is a global problem, and a quick peek into any synagogue in most places will show you that they have rows of seats to fill. But I\u2019m not sure how synagogue leaders anticipate filling the pews if they are intolerant to the joyous noise of children \u2013 the next generation of potential members.\nWhile many communities like to hold roundtable conversations about why young Jews are no longer going to synagogue or considering buying memberships, I can tell you first-hand that there is not a lot of introspection about how they treat the women and youngest Jews who come through their doors.\nSometimes my husband still goes to synagogue with the kids, but I choose to sit it out. Other times, I take my children to the park or attend a more informal, ad-hoc service outside a synagogue with my friends.\nMy generation of young Jews envisions a dynamic Judaism that isn\u2019t tethered to a physical building but understands the need for synagogues to adapt if they are to survive. Owning expensive properties and buildings isn\u2019t enough; leaders must take thoughtful measures to make both inhabitants and guests feel welcome, especially women and children. Synagogues and their management have a lot more work to do to meet 21st-century standards.\nNomi Kaltmann is an Orthodox female rabbi and the Australian correspondent at Tablet Magazine (NYC)"},

I turned this over in my head as I scanned the passenger seat of my car, piled high with takeaway containers of chicken wings. Being overfull was a familiar feeling in my work as a food critic. That crisp October day, the question was also existential \u2013 I had simply reached the end of the road.\nI\u2019d been thrilled to land my job nearly six years earlier at a newspaper covering the 3 million people and 10,000+ restaurants of New York City\u2019s eastern suburbs. I\u2019d grown up on Long Island reading Newsday, an award-winning powerhouse in the 80s and 90s, and years later had returned home for a job I initially loved. Driving hundreds of miles a week, I sometimes ate out four or five times a day as I pursued stories. Ribeye, oysters, cumin lamb, birria tacos \u2013 much of it went on my corporate credit card. The hustle was constant but the reward was unearthing under-the-radar places, dishes and people. I also wrote about wine, beer, coffee, and cocktails, which meant rubbing elbows with talented brewers and bartenders.\nWhenever someone asked what I did for a living, their eyes lit up at the response. \u201cI\u2019m a food writer,\u201d I\u2019d say, deliberately avoiding the word \u201ccritic\u201d, which sounded pompous and was actually my least favourite part of writing about food. \u201cStop. You get paid to eat? What a hard life! You have my dream job,\u201d they would invariably say.\nFrom the outside, it was a dream, and complaining seemed ungracious. So, I rarely told anyone that the work was not for the faint of heart. Literally. I lurched from plate to plate, deadline to deadline, postponing medical appointments and taking work on \u201cvacation\u201d so often that it became a running joke among friends. On the odd occasion I made it to the doctor, my blood levels told an ominous story. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that number a little lower,\u201d said my doctor as she studied my soaring cholesterol. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t control what I eat,\u201d I told her.\nDuring the pandemic, eaters pivoted hard toward lasagna, fried-chicken sandwiches, mac and cheese, and cocktails to go. In turn, our team pivoted from reviews to review-esque listicles. Reporting these entailed calorific culinary surveys. Some food writers I knew had honed the art of taking one bite of everything; if I really loved a dish, I\u2019d eat more, and maybe even finish it off. I watched my weight tick upward, and workouts and daily walks had minimal effect.The occasional bout of food poisoning was a job hazard, yet it was long-term overconsumption that took the real toll.\n\u201cDid we try Lipitor?\u201d My doctor squinted at the screen. \u201cOh, yeah, we did. What was the problem again?\u201d \u201cMade my legs hurt,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhat about Livalo?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy insurance won\u2019t cover it,\u201d I told her. \u201cWell, take it easy,\u201d she warned. \u201cBecause it looks like you\u2019re also pre-diabetic.\u201d\nI processed this news while tucking into fish tacos down the street. I couldn\u2019t just not eat the tacos, or pappardelle, or Korean fried chicken, could I?\nThat may have marked the beginning of the end. Or maybe there were a few endings in succession \u2013 from the pseudo-vacations and listicle fatigue to a heart arrhythmia that required an ablation. Two days after the procedure, as I recuperated at home covered in welts, an editor texted me about a story revision.\nI hung on for another year but began to daydream about cooking at home more than one or two nights a week, about burrowing out from under infinite leftovers. It was six orders of wings in a single afternoon that finally did me in. From the front seat of my car \u2013 which doubled as an office, table, and photo studio \u2013 I wet-wiped sweet-chilli sauce from my fingers and requested a Zoom call with my boss.\n\u201cMy time at the paper has come to an end,\u201d I told her. She leaned forward. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI was. Afterwards, I felt wobbly but buoyant, as if I had instantly dropped an enormous weight. I also wondered if I\u2019d done something phenomenally stupid. Media colleagues were losing their jobs at a steady clip, and I recalled the sting of being laid off from prior positions. My journalist\u2019s savings account was less than robust.\nI didn\u2019t have much time to ruminate, as my story was due soon. Inside the next place, I took a seat at the bar, as I often did when eating alone, and ordered the wings scarpariello-style. Lacquered in a zingy vinegar sauce, they were excellent. I sampled a few while watching football on the bar TV along with the cooks, who were awaiting the dinner rush. The pandemic-era plexiglass separators were gone, and the place had reclaimed a long-absent airiness. It was the kind of detail that wouldn\u2019t make it into an SEO-optimised listicle.\nIt would take a few months to retrain the colossal appetite my body had become accustomed to, but I hoped that, down the road, those months would earn me a few extra years. I miss my colleagues and a regular paycheck \u2014 entrepreneurial life can be a roller coaster \u2014 but 15 months on, I\u2019ve reversed the weight gain, lowered my cholesterol without meds, and I\u2019m no longer pre-diabetic. The most unexpected shift, though, is the reverse-aging power of stress reduction. \u201cYou look so different,\u201d more than one friend has said. \u201cYou just look\u2026.relaxed.\u201d\nCorin Hirsch is a writer who covers food, drink, and travel\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That bit has now been edited out, but what remains of the ad purports to be a 90-second portrait of life in the capital since London mayor Sadiq Khan \u201cseized power\u201d. Given that Khan has twice won the London mayoralty in free and fair votes, this feels somewhat punchy talk from a party led by an unelected man who himself \u201cseized power\u201d from the salad-vanquished political corpse of an unelected woman.\nBut look, what\u2019s the worst that can happen if political parties tell blatant untruths to people, debase campaigning standards and conduct knowing assaults on trust?

Apart from all the obviously disprovable fakery and dishonest manipulations and misrepresentations that we\u2019ll come to in a minute, the entire ad is inexplicably voiced by an actor doing a bad American accent. Why? He doesn\u2019t even go here. And yes \u2013 I get that on the one hand, this opens me up to the possibility of the actor who voiced the ad identifying himself and crossly declaring himself to be an actual American, perhaps hailing from one of the regions where they have unconvincing American accents.\nOn the other hand, this course of action would involve him identifying himself as the person who voiced this embarrassing ad, so \u2026 I\u2019m feeling relatively safe. Indeed, given I live in London I am feeling relatively safe anyway, what with the Crime Survey for England and Wales reporting that residents of the capital are less likely to be victims of crime than across the country as a whole.\nAnyway: the ad. Suffice to say that every creative decision taken on the script seems to have been signed off by a beta version of ChatGPT or someone who has suffered a recent head trauma.

But do they?\nOf similar concern is the decision to use a scare graph that, upon closer inspection, appears to resemble a graph showing crime in England and Wales significantly overtaking crime in London. But hey, it\u2019s a graph, it looks the part, it\u2019s got two lines crossing in a way that looks the right stripe of worrying.\nThe wider purpose of the ad is an attempt to cast London as a Gotham desperately in need of a Batman. Off the back of that statement, can I bring myself to type the words \u201cEnter Susan Hall\u201d? Yes I think I can, just for the mirthless laugh. Enter Susan Hall. If you\u2019re not familiar with Susan, she\u2019s the Conservative candidate running against Khan, and is arguably the final form in a long series of Tory mayoral hopefuls of whom the only question that can ever be asked is, \u201cOh wow \u2013 where on earth did they find that one?\u201d\nWhere DID they find Susan? Possibly on account of her lurid social media history, she\u2019s been described as a populist, and for much of her time since selection has come off as the best kind of populist \u2013 one who is not very popular. Having said that, the picture has distinctly shifted in recent months, and noises from the Labour campaign are increasingly strangulated. There is at least a small possibility that Hall could win \u2013 which would ironically be one of the most compelling arguments that London is having some form of existential crisis.\nNone of which is to suggest that Khan is the most exceptional of rivals. For my money he has been a very indifferent mayor, and anyone seeking a third term should be expected to be judged and attacked on their record. But the fact that he isn\u2019t, in ads like this, does matter. It does matter if parties fake scenes of terror in a London Underground station that turns out to be in New York. It does matter if untruths are told because it\u2019s easier than fighting truthfully. And \u2013 as discussed here previously \u2013 it matters when the other side do it too. It mattered when Keir Starmer decided to release an attack ad featuring a picture of a grinning Rishi Sunak and the slogan: \u201cDo you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nAll of these things matter and don\u2019t result in anything good. We already know where assaults on truth lead, because we\u2019ve seen them happen in other countries and in some cases our own, and people on all sides have spent a lot of the past decade lamenting it. The tragedy is that we all know it, and even the people who come up with the ads know it \u2013 but they\u2019re still doing it because they think that it works in the very short term. Yet in the long term, it really, really doesn\u2019t \u2013 which makes doing it anyway pretty criminal in itself.\nMarina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},

But then I was forced to confront my decades-long resentment", "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 09.00 CET", "content": "\u201cWhy are you fat, and why is she thin,\u201d a puzzled middle-aged man asked, as my identical twin Katy and I strolled into a restaurant in central Mumbai for a post-yoga samosa. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had been asked this question \u2013 but each time it hurt just as much, and stoked a decades-long resentment towards my sister, who was always being told she was better looking than me.\nAs children, we had relished in our identicalness and were joined at the hip. Physically, the only way people (even family members) could tell us apart was by our face shape. I had a slightly rounder face than Katy, with chubby cheeks that earned me the nickname Chipmunk growing up. Katy and I got the same grades, had the same interests, and on birthdays and Christmases got given identical gifts \u2013 but in different colours. We were inextricably \u201cone\u201d.\nBut when we were 13, the cracks began to show. At secondary school we begrudgingly agreed to be separated into different classes, forcing both of us to stand on our own feet for the first time. As the more naive sister, I trusted that our separation would be good for us in time \u2013 that it might help us to forge our own individuality within our closeness. Katy, on the other hand, struggled with her newfound independence.\nIt began with a skipped meal here and there, and an extra walk around the block at lunchtime. After a few months of restrictive dieting and obsessive exercising, Katy had started to lose weight, and a close family member noticed the stark difference in physical appearance between the two of us. Suddenly, we weren\u2019t identical any more.\nOver the next seven years, Katy was in and out of psychiatric units across the country, being treated for anorexia. I expressed my grief through frustrated, teary outbursts where I begged her to \u201cjust eat, like a normal person\u201d. I would visit her after school, at weekends and in the holidays, feeling abandoned, lost and rejected. We refer to this period of our life as the years we \u201chated each other\u201d. I hated the fact I couldn\u2019t live my life as a \u201cnormal\u201d teenager, and she hated how much I hated her.\nAs Katy recovered, our relationship improved. But comments on our physical differences persisted, and they started to affect me. One guy at a party even dared to say to his friend, in earshot: \u201cI\u2019m more attracted to Katy because she\u2019s thinner than Lara.\u201d Our trip to India together had been about trying to repair our fractious bond and embark on yoga teacher training together \u2013 but the comments followed us there, too.\nI realised all the resentment I had been carrying for the past seven years was starting to express itself in a self-destructive and toxic way. I had started to hate myself. I felt less than, invisible, and defeated by my sister\u2019s illness; as if I could never just be enough the way I am. I entertained fantasies that she would always be the more attractive, thinner twin that everyone rallied around. My self-worth had evaporated and I started to lose weight. For two years, we became competitors.\nBut when our dad died three years ago, it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I realised that life was too short to keep comparing myself with my sister, and tying my identity and self-worth to our identicalness.\nI read self-help books religiously to try to improve my body image and self-esteem, like Health at Every Size and Women Don\u2019t Owe you Pretty. I listened to podcasts like Seems Like Diet Culture and ritualised cringe-worthy daily affirmations that I performed in the mirror.\nNow, when people comment on our differences, the result is night and day. Sometimes I still feel insecure, but there are more liberating moments, too, when I think, \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with being bigger than my twin sister, anyway?\u201d It was only when I stopped feeling like the victim of other people\u2019s judgments \u2013 which are ultimately out of my control \u2013 that I finally stopped comparing my weight, size and perceived attractiveness with my twin sister. In doing so, I was able to regain the self-confidence I once had, and finally allow our twinship to truly thrive.\nLara Rodwell is a freelance journalist and author\nIn the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

{"headline": "The Zone of Interest is a portrait of guilt. No wonder it has divided opinion in Germany", "author": "Fatma Aydemir", "teaser": "Most Germans insist their ancestors weren\u2019t Nazis. Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film pries away at the cracks in this narrative", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 08.00 CET", "content": "There is something unsettling about sitting in a German theatre laughing at Nazis. How unsettling depends on the type of humour that prompts the laughter. Is it meant to set the audience apart from the stage action, or does the laughter stem from the discomfort of proximity? When I saw the satire Nachtland staged recently at Berlin\u2019s prestigious Schaub\u00fchne (a production also runs in an English translation at the Young Vic in London until 20 April), I perceived the ripples of laughter filling the room as a sort of embarrassed self-awareness. Like a tense moment of getting caught \u2013 a feeling that every storyteller ultimately longs to evoke.\nIn the play, which has a present-day setting, two siblings find a painting signed by \u201cA. Hitler\u201d in their dead father\u2019s house. Once they realise that the kitschy artwork is worth more than \u20ac100,000 if they can credibly authenticate the artist as Hitler, the siblings start recasting their entire family history in a different light. While the previous narrative had insisted that \u201cour family had nothing to do with the Nazis\u201d (the dominant account in most German households), now suddenly the late grandmother is not only found to be a committed follower of Nazi ideology, but to have had a love affair with Hitler\u2019s secretary. As the new family history pragmatically, and profitably, unfolds, it becomes much more realistic, ironically, than the hitherto official version.\nSurveys have found that most Germans claim their family members did not actively support the Nazis. Ten percent say they don\u2019t know for sure, which could simply mean they never asked. Almost 30% even believe their ancestors were part of the resistance and helped potential victims of Nazi crimes survive or hid them in their own houses. Mathematically, the numbers don\u2019t add up \u2013 if they were accurate, millions of lives could have been saved. But psychologically, this self-perception gives deep insight into how collective remembrance of the Holocaust works for many Germans: There is guilt, but it is externalised. Nazis were always the others, the evil monsters from the History Channel; certainly not Grandpa Hans, who left a remarkable fortune he came into possession of during the early 1940s. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know\u201d is a common phrase you would hear from contemporary witnesses asked about the systematic annihilation of Jews, before this generation started to die.\nThis is the context in which to understand why Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film The Zone of Interest has received mixed reviews from German critics. The film has won international acclaim, honoured by two Oscars, one of them for best international feature film, as well as the Grand Prix in Cannes. But in Germany the film has not drawn universal approval. Glazer\u2019s focus on the idyllic family life of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss and his wife, Hedwig, in their home next to the concentration and extermination camp has been praised by some as the first feature movie to appropriately speak of the unspeakable horror of Auschwitz. Others, however, have said it represents a \u201ctrivialisation of the evil\u201d. The visual absence of camp inmates is especially controversial (we only hear them in the movie and watch the H\u00f6ss family ignoring the horrible sounds coming from the other side of the wall). It is either praised as a stringent examination of German repression, or slated as an \u201cannihilation of antisemitic violence\u201d.\nLeaving aside that provocative wording, it is true that Glazer\u2019s film shows antisemitic violence in just a few scenes, but that does not minimise it \u2013 rather, it underlines it even more effectively. The Nazi family knows what\u2019s going on next door; they approve of it; they are not even conflicted about it. Of course, this is a story about a privileged Nazi commandant who oversaw mass murder, and not your average German family living through the second world war. But in the naturalistic way the characters talk about daily banalities or care for their kids, their garden, their pets and their beautiful house \u2013 the way they don\u2019t have to care about anything outside \u2013 they could be seen to also represent the idealised, self-interested, bourgeois, even aspirational family today. Interestingly, the film doesn\u2019t bother to make the viewer identify with the Nazi family; the camera always observes them from a safe distance. The characters appear schematic, but not in the same way as the perpetrators from other Holocaust films. They resemble, rather, a normal, white, heteronormative German family.\nMight it be triggering to German audiences to watch such familiar domesticity intertwined so closely with the unimaginable crimes next door? Or that there is nothing to laugh or cry about in The Zone of Interest: no catharsis, no relief, just the constant unease of the diffuse horror in the background? The sounds from the camp and the technical conversations about the efficiency of the ovens instantly bring to mind images of Auschwitz. The film presupposes the audience knows about Auschwitz. At least in Germany, of all places, this is an assumption that can be made because of the country\u2019s \u201cremembrance culture\u201d.\nThis Erinnerungskultur, or commitment to face up to the nation\u2019s crimes under nazism, is, according to the social scientist Samuel Salzborn, mainly characterised by official commemoration and private denial, a deep gap between the domestic and the public sphere. The Jewish-German writer Max Czollek describes German memory culture as an effort \u201cto reconcile the Germans with themselves\u201d.\nBut there is no room for reconciliation in The Zone of Interest. While German film productions on the Third Reich made in recent decades tend to stress the potential for acts of resistance even among higher ranking circles of the Wehrmacht, Glazer\u2019s film allows resistance only in the shape of a lonely Polish girl hiding apples in bushes for Auschwitz inmates. It concentrates on looking at the perpetrator. Not with disgust, not with compassion: it just looks. This film is a depiction of guilt. And that, perhaps, is, above all, why it sits uneasily with German audiences. The guilt we see can\u2019t be externalised or historicised: it is ubiquitous and ageless. Its germ cell lies in the aspirations and wealth of the nuclear family; in the pragmatism and self-righteousness that give rise to their complicity in genocide. That the film has divided opinion in Germany only proves how powerful this approach really is.\nFatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based Guardian Europe columnist\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "The poor need the money, the rich may not \u2013 but I say hands off the state pension triple lock", "author": "Owen Jones", "teaser": "The policy has its critics, but as Tories and Labour vow to keep it, I back its retention. It can be made fair, and a state should care for its people", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "A wealthy nation can afford to offer a comfortable and secure existence for all of its citizens. If it chooses not to do so, that is a political choice. If rationality reigned supreme, this would prove the starting point for all decisions about how society is organised. Bad news: it doesn\u2019t, and instead much of the vast riches generated by the graft of millions of workers ends up hoovered into the bank accounts \u2013 and offshore tax havens \u2013 of a tiny few. The result? It\u2019s easy to encourage the general population to believe that they\u2019re locked in trench warfare over ever-scarcer resources, with so little to go around that politics is merely the art of managing a zero-sum game.\nEnter, then, the question of the triple lock on the state pension, which both Tories and Labour have confirmed will feature in their upcoming manifestos. First introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010, it ensures that pensioners\u2019 entitlements increase each April in line with whatever is highest: inflation, the average increase in wages, or a 2.5% minimum. That means more than \u00a3100bn is now splashed on the state pension each year, by far the biggest single item of social security spending, while working-age benefits have fallen drastically behind. When you include other entitlements, well over half of the welfare state ends up in pensioners\u2019 bank accounts. At the same time, more than 60% of older Britons own their home outright, sitting on golden eggs that have only appreciated in value.\nYou can see why Britain has become a petri dish of generational resentment. Since the dawn of the triple lock, our working-age population has suffered the most protracted squeeze in living standards since records began. Younger Britons, in particular, have been devastated by a social tsunami: real-terms cuts to their education, stagnating pay packets, student debts, collapsing homeownership, a rip-off private rented sector, a devastated welfare state \u2013 well, we truly could go on.\nThe resentment only deepens. While older Britons have been gifted with the protections of social democracy, they have consistently voted for their grandchildren to be blasted with the icy chills of \u201csink or swim\u201d capitalism. It is not widely appreciated that, when Labour suffered its 2019 electoral cataclysm, it actually won more votes from the working-age population than the Tories; 57% of Britons in their 60s voted Tory in 2019, for those in their 70s, that figure rose to a staggering 67%. Younger citizens largely saw Brexit as an attack on their futures, a rupture only made possible thanks to grey voters, while much of the so-called culture wars boils down to a backlash among older Britons against the increasingly progressive values of millennials and generation Z.\nBut believing that the woes of the young can be solved by diminishing provision for the old is a grave mistake. More than 2 million pensioners languish beneath the poverty line \u2013 an increase in relative poverty rates compared with a decade ago. In a list comparing incomes against the cost of living in 30 European nations, the British state pension appears at a mediocre number 16. Britain is the sixth-largest economy on Earth, yet even now remains incapable of offering a basic contract: that every Briton should be assured comfort and security in their final years.\nThose who advocate a less generous state pension are unintentionally attacking the young. After all, we are all aspirational pensioners. If our state pension increases at a lesser rate, where will that leave today\u2019s 25-year-old, whenever they\u2019re able to retire? After all, siren voices already advocate hiking it to 71. It is the working class, as ever, who will be punished. On average, the less well-off not only have shorter lifespans than the affluent: they tend to suffer ill health sooner, robbing them of comfortable retirements. They are less likely, of course, to have assets and means to supplement the state pension. Those robbed of security in earlier years will suffer the same fate later on, especially if they have less.\nThere is a predictable retort: what of the 3 million pensioners with household wealth valued at over \u00a31m? Why do they need state pensions at all? This inevitably always takes the conversation to the question of means testing, which is not only expensive and bureaucratic, but leaves many vulnerable citizens failing to claim support they need. As it is, more than a third of families eligible for the means-tested pension credit, for example, do not claim it.\nThe answer here is obvious. The dividing line that really matters is who has wealth, and who does not. Generous universal entitlements are the only proven means of ensuring that all who need support receive it. You can then simply recoup revenue from wealthy pensioners through taxation. Indeed, a detailed study by the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 \u2013 which brought together academics and tax specialists \u2013 found that a one-off wealth tax on millionaire couples paid at 1% a year for half a decade would raise \u00a3260bn. Much of that would come from prosperous pensioners, of course, but also from Britons of any age of substantial means. This vast sum could lift the living standards of all struggling Britons, irrespective of age.\nAnd that\u2019s what matters. Politicians of all parties have left us believing that there simply aren\u2019t the resources to solve our problems. That reduces society to a cauldron of often dangerous resentments, variously encouraging many to believe that our lives would be better if the undeserving would stop hogging meagre services and entitlements: often, the demonised foreigner, or supposedly feckless fellow Brits.\nFor many younger citizens, their worldviews understandably defined by their chronic economic insecurity and inclusive social values, there lurks the spectre of the bigoted, entitled, selfish boomer, whose dreadful electoral choices have robbed them of their futures. It\u2019s an understandably seductive narrative, but offers false solutions that will only hurt them more.\nThis is a rich nation. It suits those with booming fortunes to pretend otherwise, because it would lead to demands that they stop appropriating the nation\u2019s wealth. It suits them well when we squabble among ourselves.\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},

Interveners can put a case without being among the main parties to the litigation.\nFor Women Scotland is challenging whether Scottish government legislation aimed at improving gender balance on public boards should include transgender women.\nThe Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018 has been the subject of a long-running court action by the group, which most recently resulted in a ruling by Lady Haldane at the court of session that it was lawful to extend the definition of \u201cwoman\u201d to transgender women with a gender recognition certificate.\nMcCloud, who transitioned in the late 1990s and subsequently changed her legal sex under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, is supported in her application by the Good Law Project.\nShe is concerned about the effect of a successful appeal \u2013 which would affect the whole of the UK \u2013 on her legal recognition.\nMcCloud cannot speak directly to the media because of judicial constraints. A friend of hers said: \u201cThis would mean in practice that women like her [with a gender recognition certificate] would lose rights to equal pay with men and experience restricted rights to services or moves to exclude her from spaces such as women\u2019s lavatories.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands that if the For Women Scotland appeal succeeds, McCloud and her family have made provision to emigrate to an EU state where she would remain legally recognised as a woman.\nLast month McCloud, 54, announced that she was resigning from the bench in April after 14 years as a full-time judge, citing the toxic climate towards transgender individuals in the UK.\nIn her resignation letter to the lady chief justice, president and vice-president of the king\u2019s bench division, she wrote: \u201cI have reached the conclusion that in 2024 the national situation and present judicial framework is no longer such that it is possible in a dignified way to be both \u2018trans\u2019 and a salaried, fairly prominent judge in the UK.\u201d\nAccording to For Women Scotland, which won an earlier judicial review of the act, the conflicting Scottish rulings \u201cshow that a definition of \u2018sex\u2019 that is inclusive of a person\u2019s \u2018acquired gender\u2019 on a gender recognition certificate leaves the Equality Act opaque and unworkable for many women. There needs to be clarity that sex is a biological term.\u201d\nIt argues that Haldane\u2019s inclusive definition of \u201csex\u201d leaves service providers of single-sex spaces \u201cconfused and \u2026 at risk of legal action for unlawful discrimination\u201d.\nDescribing the case as \u201ctruly historic\u201d, the author and campaigner JK Rowling has donated \u00a370,000 to For Women Scotland\u2019s crowdfunder for the action, which currently sits at nearly \u00a3150,000.\nThe executive director of the Good Law Project, Jo Maugham, said: \u201cSo many of these cases \u2013 about and with profound effects on the lives of trans people \u2013 are decided without any trans people in the room. Sometimes this happens because trans people can\u2019t afford representation \u2013 they have no billionaire funders.\n\u201cSometimes because it is said that trans people are self-interested \u2013 as though decisions about, say, black people should be made by white people.

But how can you work out what suits the moment? And the best way to get rid of a stink? Perfumers reveal how to make your world smell fantastic.1. Smell is an extreme sensation\u201cScent provokes a visceral reaction,\u201d says Ezra-Lloyd Jackson, a perfumer and artist who makes wearable fragrances under the brand name deya and creates scent installations for art exhibitions. What fascinates him about working with scent is the process of transforming \u201csomething that is grotesque or alarming into something that is familiar and comforting, or vice versa\u201d.\n2. Your reaction to a smell is linked to memoryMaya Njie makes perfumes inspired by her Swedish and Gambian heritage. She tried to capture this feeling in other artistic forms before realising that what she really wanted was to portray the way it smelled. \u201cWe know that our sense of smell is directly linked to the part of the brain where our memories are stored,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it makes a lot of sense that fragrance and smells are connected to our memories. If you smell something that someone has worn, or you go to a house that belongs to your grandparents, smelling makes you feel way more emotional than a photo ever could.\u201d Jackson describes this as \u201cinternal time travel. It is another form of communication that isn\u2019t linguistic.\u201d3. It is possible to train your nose\u201cThat is what perfume is all about,\u201d says Jackson. He didn\u2019t have a very orthodox route into perfumery: \u201cI went straight into a laboratory and got to work, but most people will train at one of the schools in France, where the first year is all about learning 500 smells.\u201d Brighton-based French perfumer Elodie Durande, who works for Somerset label Ffern, honed her craft at the University of Montpellier. \u201cYou start out by working on your olfactory skills, remembering smells and describing smells,\u201d before receiving a wide-ranging education about the perfume industry, she says.\nLearning about scent applies not just to those who work in it, but those who wear it, too. \u201cYou can figure out what scent suits you by literally going around in your regular life and being sure to smell,\u201d says Mandy Aftel, a natural perfumer who lives in Berkeley, California and runs a fragrance museum, the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents. \u201cParticipate more in your life, bring your consciousness into a cup of coffee or when you\u2019re baking; smell the oven and the smells of baking will evolve. All we need to do is close our eyes, inhale and be there. And it will become clear to you what you like.\u201d4. You can change how you feel about a smell \u2013 if you want to\u201cIf there is a perfume that someone wore when you were younger and it makes you feel uncomfortable, or an ex-partner wore a perfume and you smell it again, it can be interesting to reclaim that smell,\u201d says Njie. \u201cSo instead of smelling it every now and again, and feeling the way that you do, you would buy a sample of it and start wearing it \u2013 doing things that make you dissociate from that particular person. You can recreate memories and connections to it.\u201d\nBut you should proceed with caution, advises Aftel: \u201cIf a fragrance reminds you of someone who stopped your heart, you should avoid it. It is a part of who you are and that should be honoured. On the other hand, if you really got over that person, it may be a victory dance to feel that it no longer bothers you. But it has to be an evolution inside of you.\u201d\n5. Take your time choosing a fragranceYou need to be in the right mood when shopping for a new scent, explains Lynn Harris, the perfumer behind the Perfume H and Miller Harris labels. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing an item of clothing \u2013 you have to be calm and not in a rush.\u201d Don\u2019t be intimidated by fragrance, she says. Tell the sales assistant the kind of things you like and they will help you to find something.\n6. Pick a fragrance for the time of year \u201cFind a fragrance that fits you for the season,\u201d says Harris. \u201cI think that is key because that is how we treat our wardrobe in general; it needs to be reinvigorated and fragrance is the same, because it will stop working for you just like that. So go into it thinking, \u2018I am going to have one for spring. What do I want? Do I want something fresh? Do I want something green?\u2019 And then in the winter, you may think, \u2018I want something to cocoon me, to nurture me but smell sexy at the same time.\u2019\u201d\n7. Test it on your skin\u201cOnce you\u2019ve found two fragrances that you quite like and they\u2019re doing something for you olfactory-wise, try them on your skin,\u201d says Harris. \u201cOne fragrance on each wrist and perhaps another somewhere up your arm. Try no more than three. It is quite good to take a tester card and then, maybe later in the day, check it and see if it\u2019s doing anything for you. But that initial skin contact and your reaction to it is very important. It should be giving you pleasure; making you feel inquisitive and emotional. Give it three to five minutes and if it\u2019s still working, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d\nFragrance comes to life on the skin, says Njie. \u201cTemperature plays a part, which is why we spray on pulse points and it is why fragrance may come alive more in the summer, whereas in the winter it may be flatter.\u201d\n8. Wear what you like, not what you think you should likeFragrance has traditionally been marketed as \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d \u2013 interestingly, certain flowery notes were once considered the latter \u2013 and something used to attract the object of your affection, says Njie, who makes gender neutral perfumes. \u201cBut really, all those lines are so blurred\u201d \u2013 now, it is more about \u201cmaking you feel a certain way about yourself, more confident or secure or all of these different emotions that fragrance can bring to us\u201d.9. Scent can be used to lift or reflect your mood \u201cAll of my perfumes are very mood driven,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI have some perfumes that are sad, some that are kind of sexy for a date night, others that are relaxing \u2013 like being in nature in the trees.\u201d They can also be chosen to mark a special occasion, such as a birthday, wedding or significant life change. \u201c[You can] dedicate a particular scent to it that isn\u2019t an every day one,\u201d says Jackson, setting yourself up to make new memories with your chosen fragrance.10. Spritz where you will most enjoy it\u201cI spray on my wrist and on the back of my neck,\u201d says Njie, \u201cbecause I find that if you spray it at the front, you smell it constantly and get used to the fragrance faster than you would if it wasn\u2019t in your peripheral area the whole time. I like to spray it on my clothes, if I feel as if I\u2019ve got fabric that can handle it; I like it on a coat sleeve before I leave the house \u2013 that way I can access it more easily. My hair is very short but I know that the girls in the studio spray a bit and walk into it and it wafts in your hair throughout the day.\u201d\nDurande agrees that wearing perfume on your chest means you sense it too much, which soon means that \u201cyou can\u2019t consciously smell it anymore\u201d. The trick instead is to \u201ctry to apply it to different parts of your body, on your wrist or even on your legs \u2013 anywhere that has motion. That way, when you move, you will get a whiff of perfume.\u201d\n11. Don\u2019t be too overpowering\u201cIt is good to keep other people in mind,\u201d says Njie. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in smaller spaces, travelling or working in an office, you may want to take others into account. I don\u2019t believe that if a fragrance reaches across the room and it is eye-watering, then it means that it is good and you have got a lot for your buck. Something that is subdued and more sophisticated can be equally as beautiful. It is nice to have a smell that is more intimate \u2013 that people who come close to you get to enjoy.\u201d\nHarris agrees: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s tasteful to invade other people\u2019s space with fragrance. It should be for you and those immediately close to you.\u201d When you can no longer smell your fragrance, reapply it to a different part of the body, suggests Durande.\n12. Choose something that will last\u201cAnything with a deeper smell \u2013 something woody, ambery, richer \u2013 and sweeter scents like vanilla or caramels \u2026 these are all base notes, the longer lasting ingredients,\u201d says Durande. \u201cPerfumes that contain these will retain on the skin for a bit longer.\u201d\n13. Think sustainablyNjie\u2019s eponymous brand is vegan and \u201coffers refills, and uses recycled glass and paper packaging\u201d. But sustainability in perfume is not always straightforward, so make sure you read up on how brands operate before you buy. \u201cNatural does not equal being more sustainable or safer to wear,\u201d she says. \u201cIn certain cases, the synthetic molecules are better, as they carry a lower carbon footprint and fewer allergens.\u201d\n14. How to tell a dupeThe internet is awash with cunning copies of notable perfumes, and it can be hard to tell a real fragrance from a fake one. \u201cIf it is a really good dupe, you can\u2019t really tell,\u201d says Durande. \u201cIf it is a perfume that you\u2019ve been wearing for many years, every day, and you have a good sense of smell, you will probably pick up tiny differences. Because dupes are never 100% the same, even the good ones.\u201d\n15. Sometimes it is better not to wear anything Durande barely wears fragrance. \u201cI work with smells all day long, all week, so in my free time I need a bit of a reset. I like to be in a neutral environment, to give my nose a bit of a rest,\u201d she says. Being scent-free at work, she explains, means that she can concentrate on smelling her creations all the better.\n16. In the home, embrace how life smells Don\u2019t automatically turn to a candle or incense to give a room character, says Aftel. \u201cA lot of people will scent their home with those tired old fragranced candles that are quite synthetic. But how lovely would it be, say at a dinner party, to put out things that are fragrant that are not a candle, that encourage people to touch them. With a bowl of oranges, the oil is in the skin and they are very beautiful to look at. Or maybe having a little bouquet of mint so people can rip a leaf off. Or, if you have jasmine where you live, put that on the table with a bowl of peaches \u2013 they look and smell incredible together. I grow lemons so I always have a bowl of them out. Something very simple like that is a beautiful way to include fragrance in your life.\u201d\nJackson, meanwhile, likes to embrace the smells of cooking rather than mask them, especially \u201ccardamom, frying sage with butter and cumin, honey and carrots \u2013 a match made in heaven\u201d.\n17. Make your own scent ritualsNjie does use candles and incense in her home. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I tend to do more after I\u2019ve done my chores, and it is time to relax. It\u2019s like a reward for doing something. I wouldn\u2019t light a candle if I\u2019ve got loads of stuff to do.\u201d Durande opts for palo santo or Papier d\u2019Arm\u00e9nie, which reminds her of childhood, for a similar unwinding effect. Jackson cannily sprays radiators with fragrance \u2013 as they warm, the scent is released.\n18. To remove the smell of garlic from hands \u2026\u201cWash your hands with cold water first,\u201d says Durande, \u201cbecause the hot water opens up the pores in your skin. If you clean up with hot water, some of those garlic smells are going to be trapped deeper in your skin. I\u2019ve noticed that if you rinse off or wash your hands with cold water first, it removes it better. You don\u2019t get so much in your skin, and then you can do a second wash with warm water and soap.\u201d\n19. Consider your laundry detergent \u201cThe stuff that people use to scent laundry sticks around for so long,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI believe very strongly in a person choosing to engage with a smell and choosing when it comes to an end. So if you have stuff that lasts for a really long time, or blankets things, I feel like the person smelling it may falsely think they don\u2019t like it, or that it\u2019s too much. A natural smell has an arc over time. They last, then \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 disappear.\u201d\n20. To get rid of a bad smell \u2026\u201cI would just open a window and get a draught going,\u201d says Njie. \u201cBecause otherwise you\u2019re layering over the bad smell \u2013 it is better to try to get rid of it.\u201d Aftel suggests putting frankincense resin over a tea light: \u201cIt fills your house with a beautiful, natural smell and you could cover something up with that very easily.\u201d Aside from that, she adds, simply \u201copen the windows and pray\u201d."},

Its catastrophism is at least even handed: heat pumps, which the Telegraph doesn\u2019t like, are \u201cdead\u201d; the Conservative party, which it mostly supports, faces an \u201cextinction-level event\u201d.\nTo use a reference its readers would get, it is the Private Frazer of British newspapers \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re doomed \u2013 doomed!\u201d as the Hebridean soldier-undertaker from Dad\u2019s\u00a0Army used to say. This\u00a0might possibly be true, but not in the ways the Telegraph imagines.\nIn other media snowflake news, the Daily Mail has accused the National Trust of banning mushrooms. \u201cThe fungi is [sic] boycotted,\u201d it said. It isn\u2019t \u2013 just the mushrooms grown with peat, to protect plover and dragonfly habitats. (And the Trust\u2019s tearooms have sourced alternatives grown in other ways.) This tells you all you need to know about the obsessive campaigns against the Trust run by opaquely funded rightwing thinktanks and their allies in the press \u2013 in particular, how much they are rooted in reality.\nSo it was good to hear the historian and national treasure Mary Beard, while giving the Trust\u2019s Octavia Hill lecture last week, take apart some of the moaners\u2019 pet peeves. A derided 2020 report into links between National Trust properties and colonisation and slavery was, she said, \u201cstating the bleeding obvious\u201d. The installation of a disco ball in Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire is a harmless, and easily reversible, way of engaging children, while also highlighting that its revered interiors were originally party spaces. \u201cThe pomposity and self-righteousness\u201d of the attackers, she said, \u201cis best responded to by a bit of a giggle\u201d.

To judge by the way that towers like this are almost always built, it would lack the grace and joy to pull off a giant architectural joke, which would leave it looking like nothing but a cynical ploy.\n Rowan Moore is the Observer\u2019s architecture critic"},

{"headline": "Euro 2024 power rankings: a look at the 24 teams going to Germany", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 09.00 CET", "content": "This was not a vintage window for Didier Deschamps\u2019 side with a home defeat against Germany followed up by a shaky 3-2 win against Chile in Marseille. The captain, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, had a difficult few days and the absence of Antoine Griezmann, who missed his first France games for seven years because of injury, was clearly felt. There were positives, however, with the 18-year-old Warren Za\u00efre-Emery having a good game against Germany and Randal Kolo Muani scoring and assisting against Chile. Deschamps made nine changes for the second game with William Saliba getting a rare start in Marseille, even though the coach had said beforehand that the Arsenal player \u201cdoes things he doesn\u2019t like\u201d. Still the team to beat. Marcus Christenson\nThe results in these friendlies will not matter come the start of the Euros yet England\u2019s celebrations after Jude Bellingham\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser against Belgium on Tuesday night showed they did not want another defeat. \u201cWe knew the rubbish we would get,\u201d said the goalscorer. Having lost to Brazil on Saturday, there was a much-improved performance against the Red Devils with the 18-year-old midfielder Kobbie Mainoo the standout performer. The two games, though, showed that Gareth Southgate will need Harry Kane fit in Germany to be able to threaten the best. MC\nCrisis, what crisis? The Euro 2024 hosts, who looked in disarray only four months ago, will approach the tournament with an almighty spring in their step following victories against France (away) and the Netherlands (home). The 2-0 win in Lyon was particularly impressive, Florian Wirtz scoring a wonderful goal after seven seconds, as the winning margin could have been even bigger. Toni Kroos was back dictating things in central midfield, where Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Robert Andrich impressed next to the Real Madrid veteran. Julian Nagelsmann made no changes between the two games, which meant two starts for Stuttgart\u2019s 27-year-old left-back Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt, who was on the bench for Hertha Berlin as they were relegated last season but now looks like a certain starter for the Euros. MC\n\u201cA game against Brazil is never a friendly,\u201d Dani Olmo said after the tempestuous 3-3 draw at the Bernab\u00e9u on Tuesday night, a game that had it all: great goals, feisty challenges and calamitous mistakes. Tempers threatened to boil over after Brazil\u2019s late equaliser and subsequent celebrations and the Spain coach, Luis de la Fuente, was dismayed that a section of the crowd had booed the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker \u00c1lvaro Morata. Spain were superb in the first half and would likely have run away with the game but for an Unai Sim\u00f3n mistake after 40 minutes with Spain 2-0 up. The 16-year-old Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal was outstanding on the right wing and looks set to be one of the most exciting players at this summer\u2019s Euros. The fireworks at the Bernab\u00e9u made up for the disappointing performance in the 1-0 defeat against Colombia in London on Friday and, as De la Fuente said: \u201cWe learn more from defeats than from victories.\u201d MC\nAnd so, in the 12th game of Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s Portugal reign came the first defeat. After an immaculate qualifying campaign, with 10 wins in 10 games and a goal difference of +34, as well as an impressive 5-2 win against Sweden on Thursday, Portugal slumped to a 2-0 defeat in Slovenia after a lacklustre performance. It should act as a wake-up call but no need to press any panic buttons yet. The game did, however, provide more evidence, if needed, of the importance of Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva, both of whom did not play in Ljubljana. \u201cThe objective of these fixtures was not to win,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez before adding \u201calthough we never like to lose\u201d. The Spaniard called up more than 30 players for the two games and gave most of them a chance. Nuno Travassos\nGames against Scotland and Germany produced a mixed bag of results, performances and even formations for Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. They beat the Scots 4-0 in Amsterdam having being lined up by Koeman in a 4-3-3 formation, and while the scoreline may suggest it was a cakewalk for the Oranje it was visitors who largely dominated proceedings, creating a host of chances but failing to take any and subsequently being punished by three Dutch goals in the last 18 minutes of the game, scored by Georginio Wijnaldum, Wout Weghorst and Donyell Malen, following Tijjani Reijnders\u2019 strike five minutes before half-time. It was an impressive show of ruthlessness by the Dutch that was again on show four minutes into Tuesday\u2019s game against Germany when Joey Veerman gave the visitors the lead in Frankfurt with a well-taken volley. The Netherlands, back in a more usual 3-5-2 formation, continued to threaten on the counterattack but failed to score again while allowing Germany to do so twice, through Mittelst\u00e4dt and Niclas F\u00fcllkrug. Koeman\u2019s side look dangerous but will need tightening up defensively if they are to make progress once back in Germany this summer. Sachin Nakrani\nBelgium ended the international window unbeaten in 12 games under their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, but that was largely where the encouragement started and ended. The world\u2019s fourth-best team looked anything but in a goalless draw with Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Saturday, a game that could well have ended in defeat had Evan Ferguson not missed an early penalty for the hosts, and while a stronger lineup were better against England on Tuesday, they were also pretty lucky to escape Wembley with a 2-2 draw, with Tedesco admitting afterwards that he could not bemoan Jude Bellingham\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser given how much the hosts had dominated the play. Belgium enjoyed only 37% possession and only scored twice through Youri Tielemans because of defensive errors by their opponents. Kevin De Bruyne is to come back into the team but, in general, the Red Devils don\u2019t appear to be serious contenders for the ultimate prize in Germany this summer. SN\nLuciano Spalletti took his squad to the United States for two games, against Ecuador and Venezuela, and returned home with two wins, four goals scored and one clean sheet. It was not pretty at times but Gli Azzurri set the tone with their pressing as well as work ethic and Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Lorenzo Pellegrini showed again that they are at the top of their game. Genoa\u2019s Mateo Retegui scored twice against Venezuela to confirm his status as the first-choice No 9 (although the options in that position are so few that it is one of Spalletti\u2019s major concerns going into the Euros). \u201cA very positive tour,\u201d said a pleased Spalletti, \u201cvery well organised by the federation and the team played two good games.\u201d MC\nAfter 174 caps and 18 years with the national team Luka Modric finally lifted an international trophy. It may have been \u201conly\u201d the ACUD Cup \u2013 a friendly tournament organised in Cairo \u2013 but the image was striking nevertheless. Croatia played two very different games. The semi-final against Tunisia was a tedious affair in front of around 1,000 people that went to penalties after few real chances, but the final, against the hosts, who were without Mohamed Salah, saw an attendance of 83,350 at the Misr Stadium. The Vatreni looked much better in the latter, switching to a 4-2-3-1 formation from their usual 4-3-3 and exploring some other back-up options such as Josko Gvardiol at left-back (rather than centre-back) to win 4-2. Aleksandar Holiga\nIt is fair to say that Ralf Rangnick\u2019s side were not slow off the blocks this fortnight and they followed up Christoph Baumgartner\u2019s world-record (for internationals) goal after six seconds against Slovakia by taking the lead against Turkey after 103 seconds. Despite missing key players such as David Alaba, Marko Arnautovic and Marcel Sabitzer, who fell ill before the game, they went on to win 6-1, playing carefree, attacking football in front of 38,000 fans at the Ernst-Happel Stadium. It was a fifth consecutive win for Austria and Michael Gregoritsch got a hat-trick. \u201cThe second half was close to perfection,\u201d beamed Rangnick. Andreas Hagenauer\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am more positive or negative to our chances at the Euros after these two games,\u201d said an honest Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg after Denmark had drawn 0-0 against Switzerland and beaten the Faroe Islands 2-0. The coach, Kasper Hjulmand, tried different systems and players in the two games but has come in for some rare criticism recently. The fact that Christian Eriksen made the squad despite lack of playing time at Manchester United was highlighted as a sign of weakness and the former Denmark international Thomas Gravesen even wondered whether Hjulmand was still the right person for the job. \u201cIf someone really thinks that I don\u2019t pick the best player I think we have to win games \u2026 well, it is my backside on the line here too,\u201d Hjulmand responded. MC\nTwo wins from two during this international break is a real positive for Hungary, with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Turkey on Friday followed by a workmanlike 2-0 victory over Kosovo on Tuesday. Marco Rossi\u2019s much-changed side looked out of sorts in the first 45 minutes of the most recent contest and could easily have fallen behind, but three changes at half-time lit a fire under the hosts and the intensity that has come to define this team re-emerged. Right now, only Colombia have a longer unbeaten run in international football than Hungary, who haven\u2019t lost since Dominik Szoboszlai took over as captain. Instrumental again on Tuesday, the Liverpool midfielder has five goals and two assists in his last five international appearances and will be at the heart of everything Hungary aim to achieve this summer. Tom Mortimer\n\u201cThe stats don\u2019t lie,\u201d Xherdan Shaqiri said after starting on the bench for Switzerland in the 0-0 draw against Denmark. Four days later he was back in the starting XI and scored the only goal of the game against Ireland in the 1-0 win in Dublin. It was not only the goal, coming from a free-kick, that made the difference. The 32-year-old also introduced some unpredictability to the Swiss side, something that was missing against Denmark. In the end, the coach, Murat Yakin, could be fairly pleased with the team. Vincent Sierro and Dereck Kutesa made their debuts against Ireland and did not look out of place while Dan Ndoye impressed on his ninth cap. It was a welcome success for Yakin after five winless games, a run stretching back to last September. MC\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nRomania drew 1-1 with Northern Ireland and lost 3-2 Colombia during the international break. Both performances were largely average in quality, highlighting the team\u2019s weaknesses in defence and shortage of ideas in attack. Saying that, there were moments against Colombia where Romania showed flashes of old and, in that regard, it was fitting that Ianis Hagi, son of the great Gheorghe, scored having come on as a substitute. Overall, however, there is much for Edward Iordanescu\u2019s side to improve upon before they compete at Euro 2024. Emanuel Rosu\nWhat a week it has been for Poland, with two playoff wins, against Estonia and Wales, securing their place at this summer\u2019s European Championships. Each game showed different strengths of Michal Probierz\u2019s men; ruthlessness and domination in the 5-1 thrashing of Estonia in Warsaw last Thursday followed by determination and togetherness in the penalty shootout victory over Wales in Cardiff on Tuesday. The latter triumph was far from pretty \u2013 Poland did not record a shot on target until the shootout \u2013 but it also showed how far they have come after their poor group campaign under Fernando Santos. They were a collection of individuals then; now they are a team and for Robert Lewandowski comes the chance to play at what will probably be the striker\u2019s last ever major tournament. Maciej Slominski\nThere was some consternation in Serbia from people who saw this international window as a missed opportunity, that the fixture against Russia was politically motivated rather than giving Dragan Stojkovic the best chance to fine-tune his Euro plans. They lost 4-0 in Moscow after an early red card for the defender Milan Gajic, one of three players in the starting XI who ply their trade in the Russian Premier League. They then beat Cyprus 1-0 after an early Sergej Milinkovic-Savic goal but they were not at their fluent best. MC\nA pair of two 2-1 wins, away to Norway on Friday and home to Armenia on Tuesday, made this an encouraging international window for Ivan Hasek\u2019s side. It is now five games without defeat for Czech Republic with Hasek overseeing a 100% record in charge having returned to the post of head coach in January. The former Czechoslovakia captain previously led the national team for a brief spell in 2009 and will feel his team can make a mark in Germany this summer given they\u2019re in a group with Portugal, Turkey and Georgia and have a squad that contains the likes of Tomas Soucek and Patrik Schick, both of whom featured in their two most recent victories. SN\nSteve Clarke denied he is concerned about his team\u2019s form and prospects following their 4-0 trouncing by the Netherlands in Amsterdam on Friday and subsequent 1-0 loss to Northern Ireland at Hampden Park on Tuesday but he really should be. Scotland have now lost five and drawn two of their past seven matches and, overall, look shaky at the back and toothless in attack. Against Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s men they were especially lacking in imagination, which is a concern given there are only the June friendlies against Gibraltar and Finland to come in regards to rediscovering a bounce before taking on Germany in Munich in the opening game of the summer tournament. Jamie Jackson\n\u201cThis win feels phenomenal,\u201d said the assistant coach, Bostjan Cesar, after Slovenia had defeated Portugal 2-0 at the Stozice Stadium. Cesar, who stepped in after head coach Matjaz Kek\u2019s father died last week, added that they had learned their lessons from the disappointing draw against Malta five days earlier. Against Portugal everyone stepped up, from the composed Jan Oblak in goal, to an organised defence and an energy-filled attack, led superbly by Benjamin Sesko, and they deserved the win, keeping Cristiano Ronaldo and co at arm\u2019s length. The visitors had chances but Slovenia took theirs, Adam Gnezda Cerin and Timi Max Elsnik getting the second-half goals. There was praise after the game from the Portugal manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who backed Slovenia to cause problems for Group C opponents England, Serbia and Denmark at the Euros. Miran Zore\nTurkey were close to heading into Euro 2024 as dark horses after topping their qualification group, but back-to-back defeats \u2013 including a humiliating 6-1 defeat to Austria \u2013 has raised questions about Vincenzo Montella\u2019s side. In fairness they delivered a pretty good display against Hungary in Budapest on Friday and were somewhat unlucky to lose 1-0, but their inability to turn chances into goals was glaring. Bournemouth\u2019s Enes Unal performed poorly as the lone striker in a 4-2-3-1 formation and the worry is Montella does not have many alternatives. Things got much worse for Turkey at the Ernst Happel Stadium on Tuesday, with Austria dominating proceedings from start to finish, and it was somewhat telling that Turkey\u2019s goal, scored by Hakan Calhanoglu, came from the penalty spot. These defeats will come as a blow to Montella, who was asked if he would resign after the Austria game, but he has time, at least, to resolve Turkey\u2019s weaknesses between now and the summer. Emre Sarigul\nQuite apart from the geopolitical significance of their victory over Iceland on Tuesday night \u2013 and frankly, who doesn\u2019t love a little schadenfreude at the expense of Vladimir Putin? \u2013 on a purely sporting level it would have been a crashing shame if the Euros had been deprived of this richly talented Ukraine side, stuffed with promise all over the pitch. Not one but two world-class goalkeepers in Andriy Lunin and Anatoliy Trubin; the brilliant young playmaker Georgiy Sudakov; more familiar faces in Oleksandr Zinchenko and Mykhailo Mudryk, whose winning goal could be a formative moment in a still-developing international career. Sergiy Rebrov has proven a shrewd appointment as coach and if he can iron out some of this team\u2019s inconsistencies, they could do some real damage this summer. Jonathan Liew\nIt\u2019s been a difficult international window for Slovakia\u2019s head coach, Francesco Calzona. In games against Austria and Norway, he had to improvise given the absence of key players due to injury, most notably captain Milan Skriniar. The absences gave fringe players the opportunity to shine but they certainly did not do that in Friday\u2019s 2-0 loss to Austria. The performance in the 1-1 draw away to Norway on Tuesday was much improved, however. Calzona, who is combining his duties as Slovakia coach with being caretaker manager of Napoli until the end of the season, has much work to do but can at least take heart from the displays of the young centre-back Adam Obert, who impressed in both games. Lukas Vrablik\nAlbania, who topped qualifying Group E ahead of the Czech Republic and Poland, suffered two defeats, with the 3-0 reverse to Chile in Italy particularly painful. However, the head coach, Sylvinho, tried to put a positive spin on the performance. \u201cWe did create a lot of chances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe created six or seven decent chances and that is not bad against a team such as Chile. However, in the Euros we may get two or three good chances in a game \u2013 and then we have to take them.\u201d Against Sweden in Stockholm, with a large Albanian contingent in attendance, they were much better, losing narrowly 1-0 but should have had a penalty when Armando Broja was brought down in the first half. \u201cI have nothing negative to say about the players today,\u201d Sylvinho said. There is work to be done, however, if Albania are going to cause some upsets in two months\u2019 time. MC\nWilly Sagnol\u2019s side had to win two home games to reach the Euros and they did, just. Luxembourg, who had a player sent off in the semi-final, were beaten 2-0 while the final against Greece went to penalties. It was an ill-tempered game at times in front of a fanatical home support with tensions boiling over when the half-time whistle blew and a red card shown to a member of each coaching staff. When it was all done and dusted though Georgia had made history by qualifying for their first ever major tournament. \u201cSome did not believe in us but now they will believe it. We are happy. I have never had such an emotion in my life,\u201d Khvicha Kvaratskhelia told 1TV Sport. \u201cThanks to the Georgian fans. I\u2019ve played in many stadiums but I haven\u2019t seen such support anywhere. You were the most important factor.\u201d MC"},

I say: leave those kids alone!", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 12.00 CET", "content": "Being young has always been hard. Sure, it has its perks \u2013 more energy, first loves, first everythings \u2013 but I feel for the under-25s with still so many life hurdles left to clear. With the list of current social ills ranging from the housing crisis to social isolation and the any-day-now background note of environmental doom, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not easy for young people today.\nSo when research last week from MoneySuperMarket found that driving age under-25s were costing their parents \u00a31,300 a year in additional fuel from being ferried around \u2013 sparking unpleasant commentary about feckless young people \u201crefusing\u201d to drive \u2013 I found myself thinking: \u201cLeave the kids alone, they\u2019re doing their best!\u201d\nThat is not to dismiss the additional burden on parents. Fuel prices are some of the highest ever recorded. And with only one in four 17 to 20-year-olds holding a driving licence compared to one in two in 1989, many families will be feeling it. The reason why? Getting on the road costs an obscene amount: an average of \u00a37,600 with hikes in insurance and car prices included, which, once adjusted, is well over double the cost in 1989. Few young people today will have access to that sort of cash so will wait until they are older and earning more.\nI know, because I did. I passed my driving test six years ago, just weeks before my 30th birthday. I remember it well: the fail for hesitation, the fail for being pushy, the guilt about spending more on lessons because I\u2019d failed. But then \u2013 the pass! The ecstasy of a first automatic machine car-wash \u2013 the ASMR sound of success! Trust me, it may be later in life but this rite of passage still zings the same. Just offer your thirtysomething non-driver friend a lift home, or take them to a drive-thru and see the love in their eyes. You are suddenly the coolest person in sixth form. Just 15 years later.\nFortunately, while some gripe about young should-be drivers, people are more kind on TikTok. Driving instructors use the site to share tips and there is a trend of \u201celder\u201d TikTok influencers (and by that I mean, 28-year-olds) sharing their failures and passes to encourage younger learners. Personally, I feel this may be my calling. So maybe someone needs to hear this: \u201cHey, driver in progress, please know, you aren\u2019t a failure. You may have taken a wrong turn but you\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\n Coco Khan is a freelance writer and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UK"},
{"headline": "\u2018We\u2019d like to shoot them all\u2019: growing army of wolfdogs raises hackles across Europe", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "From the moment the rangers first saw him on their trail cameras, the problem was apparent. The wolf, spotted deep in the woods of Italy\u2019s Gran Bosco di Salbertrand park, was not grey like his companion, but an unusual blond. His colouring indicated this was not a wolf at all, but a hybrid wolfdog \u2013 the first to be seen so far into Piedmont\u2019s alpine region. And where one hybrid is found, more are sure to follow.\n\u201cWe thought he would go away,\u201d says Elisa Ramassa, a park ranger in Gran Bosco who has tracked the local wolves for 25 years. \u201cUnfortunately, he found a female who loves blonds.\u201d\nThe blond specimen spotted in Piedmont illustrates the latest development in a worrying new trend. Over the past two decades, Europe\u2019s decimated wolf population has slowly been resurrected through years of painstaking conservation work. Now hybrid numbers are rapidly growing \u2013 and if their spread continues, scientists fear they may put the European wolf \u2013 as a wild, genetically distinct animal \u2013 at risk of extinction.\nElisa Ramassa and fellow ranger Massimo Rosso search for wolf tracks in Gran Bosco di Salbertrand park\nIn Piedmont, the blond hybrid produced at least two sets of pups before disappearing. \u201cFrom one event, we now have several packs with hybrids,\u201d says Luca Anselmo, a wolf tracker and researcher with Life WolfAlps EU, a multi-year, multimillion dollar initiative to support the return of wolves to Europe and reduce their conflicts with humans.\nStudies point to the presence of hybrid wolfdogs, such as the one pictured, in nearly every European country with wolves\nHybrid wolfdogs are not a new phenomenon. While present-day wolves and dogs are distinct sub-species, they belong to the same canine family, and have retained genetic overlap since humans began domesticating ancient wolf ancestors thousands of years ago. Modern wolfdog hybrids had not been well-studied until recently, however, when advances in genetics made it possible to prove their existence. When Luigi Boitani, Italy\u2019s leading wolf expert, captured a hybrid in 1975, he says he \u201cwas met with everything from gentle opposition to [people who] said, \u2018this is bullshit\u2019.\u201d\nTime has proven Boitani right. Today, a growing number of studies point to the presence of hybrids in nearly every European country with wolves, and in some areas their numbers are growing steadily. In Boitani\u2019s native Tuscany, and other regions, they have become endemic, accounting for as much as 70% of the wolf population. The rise has been driven by the increasing destruction of wolf habitats and the expansion of human settlements, which bring people, their pets, and packs of stray dogs into more frequent contact with wolf packs.\nIn some regions \u201cthey are basically all hybrids,\u201d Boitani says. \u201cIn this case, there is nothing you can do. You cannot send the army and kill everything.\u201d\nHybrids trouble conservationists partly for their unpredictability. They may increase conflict with humans, crowd pure-blood wolves out of their habitat, or reduce the viability of future offspring.\nAnticlockwise from top: rangers search Gran Bosco di Salbertrand park for signs of wolves; camera traps are used to learn more about their behaviour; Luca Anselmo (left), a wolf researcher and tracker\nSome fear that interbreeding will result in the permanent loss of the wolf\u2019s distinct attributes. \u201cIf tomorrow I see an animal that is black and white, with floppy ears and a long tail, and you tell me it is a wolf, I [would be] disappointed,\u201d Boitani says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see wolves in that way.\u201d\nFor many conservationists, such hybrids represent the growing imprint of humankind on a revered wild species. Frequently, they are the result of neglected working dogs mingling with isolated wolves, whose packs may have been disrupted by culls or poaching. In the words of Ramassa, the park ranger, they are \u201ca human mistake\u201d.\n\u201cWe are speeding up a process that might have occurred naturally,\u201d says Valeria Salvatori, a wolf expert who led the first Europe-wide study into hybridisation. \u201cIt\u2019s like global warming \u2026 we do have a duty to mitigate such an impact.\u201d\nFrancesca Marucco, scientific coordinator for Life WolfAlps EU, has studied wolves for more than 20 years\nBut there is considerable disagreement about what that mitigation should look like. Some experts, like Francesca Marucco, the scientific coordinator for Life WolfAlps EU, take a harder line. \u201cWe\u2019d like to shoot \u2026 all [the hybrids] as soon as possible,\u201d she says.\nThis approach is being taken by authorities including Austria, Switzerland, Poland and Slovenia. A female wolf who reproduced with a dog in Slovenia was recently culled alongside all her offspring \u2013 save one, who made it over the border to Italy. Animal rights groups in Italy have vocally opposed culling, and hybrids are more likely to be left alive long enough to breed.\nThere is disagreement over whether hybrids should be allowed to breed or be culled\nWith such a long history of interbreeding between species, however, some conservationists question an aggressive approach. In Poland, researchers are leading investigations into the potential advantages of hybridisation. In Yellowstone national park in the US, for example, hybrid wolves were found to have higher resistance to certain diseases.\nWolfdog hybrids may also be better adapted to survive in a world where wolves are increasingly forced to live in urban environments. \u201cIn the modern, human-dominated world, maybe it is useful for the wolves to have some dog-like behaviour in them,\u201d says Miha Krofel, a Slovenian researcher. \u201cI think the costs outweigh the benefits \u2026 [but] we don\u2019t really have an understanding of how problematic hybrids are for the human-wolf conflict.\u201d\nTop: data from a tracking collar provides insights into the wolves\u2019 behaviour. Below: wolf droppings are collected for analysis\nOthers are pushing to better understand how hybrids behave in the wild, and whether they occupy wolves\u2019 ecological niche. When Anselmo\u2019s team learned of the hybrid pack in Piedmont, they set out not to kill, but capture and sterilise them. For 25 days, Anselmo and his team pursued one hybrid, who they called Godot, along the mountain slopes, observing stringent Italian welfare laws that require them to stay within 30 minutes\u2019 distance from the trap.\nAt last, Godot was captured, neutered and collared, along with one of his siblings. The data from his collar has so far shown that the hybrid pack behaves much like any other, and appears to suffer no discrimination from their full-blooded peers.\n\u201cWe feared that he would behave more like a dog \u2013 he would look for humans, or go near houses, looking for food,\u201d says Ramassa. \u201cBut no, he\u2019s like a wolf.\u201d\nUltimately, however, Anselmo admits that catch-and-release is not a practical solution at scale. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cTrapping wolves is the most difficult thing I have done in my life.\u201d\nAddressing the conservation risk that wolfdogs pose will require some consensus among scientists \u2013 and wider society \u2013 about how to respond.\n\u201cThey need to have the courage and decide: what do we want to preserve?\u201d says Salvatori. \u201cDo we want to preserve wolves?

{"headline": "Nick Cave on love, art and the loss of his sons: \u2018It\u2019s against nature to bury your children\u2019", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 06.00 CET", "content": "Nick Cave has a touch of Dr Frankenstein about him \u2013 long, white lab coat, inscrutable smile, unnerving intensity. He introduces me to his two assistants, the identical twins Liv and Dom Cave-Sutherland, who are helping to glaze his ceramics series, The Devil \u2013 A Life. The twins are not related to Cave. His wife, the fashion designer Susie Cave, came across them one day, discovered they were ceramicists and thought they would be able to help him complete his project. It adds to the eeriness of it all.\nCave, 66, is one of the world\u2019s great singer-songwriters \u2013 from the howling post-punk of the Birthday Party and the Bad Seeds to the lugubrious lyricism of his love songs (Into My Arms, Straight to You and a million others I adore) and the haunted grief of recent albums such as Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen and Carnage. He is also a fine author (see his apocalyptic novel And the Ass Saw the Angel), thinker (his book of conversations with the Observer journalist Sean O\u2019Hagan, Faith, Hope and Carnage), agony uncle (at his website, the Red Hand Files), screenwriter (The Proposition) and now visual artist. Which is where he started out half a century ago.\nCave studied art in Melbourne in the mid-70s before being chucked off his degree course. He reckons he was too fascinated by the subject for his own good. He spent all his time talking about art to the older students and didn\u2019t find the hours to do the actual work. Now, he is making up for lost time.\n\u2018These losses are incorporated into the artistic flow\u2019 \u2026 Cave\u2019s sculptures go through the glazing process. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nWe are at the headquarters of Susie\u2019s business, where she makes and stores the beautiful dresses she designs as The Vampire\u2019s Wife. For now, it\u2019s doubling as Cave\u2019s studio. He gives me a tour of the 17 ceramic figurines, which will be exhibited at Xavier Hufkens in Brussels next month. The pieces are stunning in a creepy, Cave-esque way, all blood-curdling pastoral idylls. But it\u2019s as a series that they are most powerful. The sculptures, inspired by Staffordshire \u201cflatback\u201d ceramics from the Victorian era, forge a shocking and deeply personal narrative.\nInitially, we see the devil as a child \u2013 a cute little lad, dimple-cheeked in a white jumpsuit sitting next to a red monkey. \u201cLook at his little face,\u201d Cave says, lovingly. We see the devil getting up to erotic mischief with a sailor, then ecstatic with his first love. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with this one,\u201d Cave says. \u201cHis impish pleasure and her just drained of life.\u201d\nWe see the devil going to war in a field of flowers, wading through a field of blood and skulls on his return, getting married. Then the series takes a traumatic turn. \u201cThis is The Devil Kills His First Child,\u201d Cave says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little Isaac and Abraham thing. Then he\u2019s separated from the world. Life goes on. Then he dances for the last time.\u201d And now we are at the final piece. \u201cHe bleeds to death. He\u2019s found washed up and the child is forgiving him, leaning out to him with his hand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how to respond when Cave reaches the story\u2019s conclusion other than to gulp or weep. After all, this is a man who has lost two sons over the past nine years. In 2015, 15-year-old Arthur died after taking LSD for the first time and falling from a cliff near his home in Brighton. In 2022, 31-year-old Jethro, who had schizophrenia, died in Melbourne. Death and grief have informed all of Cave\u2019s work since Arthur died. But this takes it to another level.\n\u2018The child is forgiving him\u2019 \u2026 Devil Bleeds to Death, the final piece in the collection. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nWe say goodbye to the Cave twins, who continue painting pubic hair in gold lustre on the devil\u2019s first love. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you, guys! Slave away, my children!\u201d Cave says.\nLiv smiles.\n\u201cI\u2019m already dressed like a Victorian child\u2019,\u201d Dom says.\n\u201cA pint of stout for lunch!\u201d Cave says.\nWe move into Susie\u2019s office to chat. It\u2019s dark, gothic, a dream home for bats. He whips off his lab coat to reveal an immaculate three-piece suit and sits behind the desk. Before I sit down, I ask if I can do something I have wanted to do for the best part of a decade. I reach over the desk and clumsily hug him.\n\u201cAaah, man! Here, let me stand up.\u201d The last time we talked was 16 years ago. He was making a video that featured Arthur and his twin brother, Earl, who were then seven, gorgeous and already musical (Arthur was playing drums, Earl guitar).\nCave became famous as one of the bad boys of rock \u2013 a ghoulish junkie with a feral live act, equally fixated by the Bible and Beelzebub. But he is one of the nicest people I have met. In 2008, I turned up knowing sod all about him. I tell him that he was so generous with his time and nonjudgmental about my ignorance. \u201cReally?\u201d he says, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I tend to have a low opinion of myself back then. I see a cutoff point around the death of my first son of a change of character. But it\u2019s not as black and white as I thought.\u201d\nIn the studio. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nEvery Cave story seems to begin with a death. Take the origin of the figurines. He went into the studio to start work on them the day his mother, Dawn, died. He had planned to start on that date \u2013 15 September 2020 \u2013 for a while. \u201cSusie made me go. She said: \u2018Get there and do your work.\u2019\u201d He adored Dawn \u2013 she had always stood by him, no matter what trouble he was in. (The day his father died in a car crash, she was called to the police station to bail out 19-year-old Cave after he had been charged with burglary.)\nDid he have any idea what he wanted to create in the studio? No, he says, but there was an inevitability about the subject. \u201cEven when I\u2019m trying to use art to escape certain feelings and sorrows I have, everything just seems to fall into the slipstream of the loss of my son. And even when I was glazing these, Jethro died, so it\u2019s like \u2026\u201d He comes to a stop. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is these losses are just incorporated into the artistic flow and they move in a direction that is beyond your capacity to rein in. They\u2019re just sitting at the end of everything you do. In the end, the ceramics are a story about a man\u2019s culpability in the loss of his child, and addressing that in a way I wasn\u2019t really able to do with music. That\u2019s what happened without any intention.\u201d\nDoes he feel culpable for the death of his sons? \u201cI think it\u2019s something that people who lose children feel regardless of the situation, simply because the one thing you\u2019re supposed to do is not let your children die.\u201d He comes to another abrupt stop, almost as if he is dictating notes. \u201cForget that. The one thing you\u2019re supposed to do is protect your children.\u201d\nHe returns to the final figurine. \u201cYou have this hollowed-out old man with a little child, possibly a dead old man, dead in a pool of tears \u2013 a biblical flood of tears, shall we say \u2013 and the little child is reaching down in forgiveness. It\u2019s called The Devil Forgiven.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t too abstract, too woo-woo. Art has a way of bringing to you the things you need to know. It feels to me that art knows what\u2019s going on more than the artist knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nDoes he feel culpable because drugs were involved in Arthur\u2019s death? \u201cThere could be some element of that, yep. Look, these things are in our DNA, they\u2019re inherited. I don\u2019t want to make any assumptions about Arthur, who was just a young boy. It\u2019s not like he was into drugs \u2026 On a fundamental level, it\u2019s against nature to be burying your children. And there can\u2019t help but be feelings of culpability.\u201d\nCave believes he is emerging from his losses a different man. He has a point. It is hard to imagine the old Cave curating the Red Hand Files, a website in which he invites fans to ask questions about anything they want, many of them profoundly personal.\nSoon after Arthur\u2019s death, the family moved to Los Angeles for a couple of years: \u201cWe were triggered too much by things. We were just down the road from where it happened.\u201d Everybody seemed to know what had happened to Arthur, because it was so widely reported, but he says that ended up being a positive. \u201cI was forced to grieve publicly \u2013 and that was helpful, weirdly enough. It stopped me completely shutting the windows and bolting the doors and just living in this dark world.\u201d\nHe was overwhelmed by the kindness of strangers. \u201cI had letter after letter addressed to \u2018Nick Cave, Brighton\u2019. It was a really extraordinary thing. And that attention, and sense of community, was extremely helpful to me. I think people are usually just on their own with these sorts of things. Susie met somebody whose son had died seven years previously and she still hadn\u2019t spoken to her husband about it. These people are utterly alone and maybe full of rage. So I can\u2019t overstate that I\u2019ve been in an extraordinarily privileged position in that respect.\u201d\nSusie and Nick Cave at Milan fashion week in 2023. Photograph: Victor Boyko/Getty Images for Gucci\nDid his experience of bereavement help after Jethro died? \u201cYes. It really helped, because I knew I could get through. I\u2019d been through it.\u201d Did he feel cursed? \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t feel cursed, no.\u201d He says it would be wrong to talk publicly about Jethro \u2013 he didn\u2019t meet Jethro till he was seven and their relationship was complex; although they became close, it would be disrespectful to his mother, who brought him up. (Cave\u2019s first two children, Luke and Jethro, were born 10 days apart to different women.)\nCave says one way in which he has changed is that he appreciates life more. In the past, he has described learning to live again, refinding happiness, as an act of defiance. But he no longer thinks it\u2019s an appropriate word. \u201cDefiance has a fuck-you element to the world; we\u2019re not going to let it get us down. That sounds a little too heroic now. I\u2019m pretty simple-minded about things. It says something to my children who have died that I can enjoy my life now. It\u2019s what they would want. I think it\u2019s a softer relationship we have to the world now.\u201d\nRather than a two-fingered salute to fate, it goes back to culpability and his Christian (if questioning) faith. \u201cLook, this is extremely difficult to talk about, but one of the things that used to really worry me is that Arthur, wherever he may be, if he is somewhere, somehow understands what his parents are going through because of something he did, and that his condition of culpability is not dissimilar to mine. And I think that\u2019s the reason behind a lot of what I do. It\u2019s to say it\u2019s OK. I mean it\u2019s not OK, but we\u2019re OK. We\u2019re OK. I think Susie feels that, too.\u201d\nHe stresses that he is not just talking about his personal tragedies. \u201cWhat\u2019s it saying to all those who\u2019ve passed away in their multitudes if we lead lives where we\u2019re just pathologically pissed off at the world? What does it say to those who have left the world to be in a perpetual state of misery and fury and depression and cynicism towards the world? What legacy are they leaving if that\u2019s how we manifest the passing of that person?\u201d\nHe thinks people sometimes misunderstand what he is saying about loss. It\u2019s not that there is more joy in his world than there was \u2013 far from it. But when it comes, it tends to be more intense. \u201cJoy is something that leaps unexpectedly and shockingly out of an understanding of loss and suffering. That\u2019s how Susie and I are. That\u2019s in no way saying we\u2019re not affected, or we\u2019ve somehow gotten over it, or we\u2019ve had closure or even acceptance. I think closure is a dumb thing. Even acceptance is, like: \u2018Just give it a few years and life goes back to how it was.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t happen. You\u2019re fundamentally changed. Your very chemistry is changed. And when you\u2019re put back together again, you\u2019re a different person. The world feels more meaningful.\u201d\nHe knows plenty of people disagree with him. \u201cI get people, mothers particularly, occasionally saying: \u2018How dare you suggest there is joy involved in any of this?\u2019 People are so angry, and they have every right to be enraged by the fucked-up cosmic mischief that goes on, and it\u2019s deeply unfair. But it\u2019s not personal. It feels like it is, but it\u2019s just the vicissitudes of life.\u201d\nAt work. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nCave feels he is misunderstood in another way, after saying recently that he has always been \u201ctemperamentally\u201d conservative and attacking the \u201cself-righteous belief\u201d and \u201clack of humility\u201d of woke culture. This has led some to assume he is supping with the \u201calt-right\u201d, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\u201cConservatism is a difficult word to talk about in Britain, because people immediately think of the Tories. But I do think small-C conservatism is someone who has a fundamental understanding of loss, an understanding that to pull something down is easy, to build it back up again is extremely difficult. There is an innate need in us to rip shit down, and I\u2019m personally more cautious in that respect without it being a whole political ideology that surrounds me.\u201d\nIs he a Tory? \u201cI\u2019m not a Tory, no.\u201d Has he ever been? \u201cNo. No, I\u2019ve never voted Tory.\u201d And is he really anti-woke? \u201cThe concept that there are problems with the world we need to address, such as social justice; I\u2019m totally down with that. However, I don\u2019t agree with the methods that are used in order to reach this goal \u2013 shutting down people, cancelling people. There\u2019s a lack of mercy, a lack of forgiveness. These go against what I fundamentally believe on a spiritual level, as much as anything. So it\u2019s a tricky one. The problem with the right taking hold of this word is that it\u2019s made the discussion impossible to have without having to join a whole load of nutjobs who have their problem with it.\u201d\nHe hates dogma, whether religious or political. His work has always embraced uncertainty. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like me to say this, but I do feel it\u2019s in my nature to constantly be redressing the balance of my own ideas about things. My mother was exactly the same \u2013 she always saw the other side. It was incredibly frustrating. You\u2019d be angry about something and she\u2019d go: \u2018Yes darling, but \u2026\u2019\u201d\nLike his mother, he has never shied away from the trickiest \u201cbuts\u201d. When he talks about his appalling loss, he also knows he has been lucky. Not only has he been able to express his grief in his work, but it has also fed his creativity. Even at its bleakest, he has found it cathartic. \u201cMaking art is in itself the great expression of joy and optimism, in my view. That\u2019s why we need it. Music, art, reminds us of our fundamental capacity to create beautiful things out of the fuckeries of life. Even when I\u2019m making The Devil Kills His First Child, I\u2019m not depressed, I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow! Look at the head!\u2019 It\u2019s a joyful occupation, no matter what. And when I\u2019m singing a very sad lyric, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m sad inside.\u201d\nThe forthcoming Bad Seeds album is the first thing he has created since Arthur\u2019s death that isn\u2019t \u201cset through a lens of loss\u201d. He is funny when talking about his work \u2013 so angsty and uncertain early in the process, almost messianic by the end. \u201cThe new album is really good. It\u2019s really strong. Great songs,\u201d he says.\nSimilarly with The Devil \u2013 A Life. He has got over the doubts and now he is buzzing with self-belief. Is he nervous about the exhibition? \u201cNo, I\u2019m excited. I think the ceramics are really good and really strange.\u201d But he feels unusually protective towards his figurines and the story that they tell. \u201cThese guys feel extraordinarily vulnerable. They are vulnerable little things, and they are saying something deeply personal.\u201d\n Nick Cave: The Devil\u2009\u2013\u2009A Life is at Xavier Hufkens in Brussels from 5 April to 11 May\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Why has LinkedIn become so weird?", "author": "Coco Khan", "teaser": "It is now used as a full social network \u2013 and is changing how we think about our identities and accomplishments. Time for us all to be a lot more honest ...", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.33 CET", "content": "A friend recently asked me to help her look for a job. She wanted help writing a cover letter, a CV and an update on her LinkedIn profile. The first two tasks were easy, but the third? Not so much.\nIf, like me, you haven\u2019t been on LinkedIn for a while, it is \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 weird, now. What used to be a perfunctory, professional space sitting in stark contrast to the oversharing of other social media, LinkedIn is now full of 1,000-word polemics from unqualified people (\u201chere\u2019s really what makes people tick\u201d says a \u201cwizard of wellbeing\u201d), photos of holidays (\u201cwork hard, play hard!\u201d) and empty motivational platitudes (\u201cgive a man a fish and he\u2019ll eat for a day, teach a man to code and \u2026\u201d OK, sorry, I did just make that one up). It\u2019s all a bit cultish, and work is what is worshipped. Stepford Wives, employment edition.\nLinkedIn even has its own language now. Spend more than five minutes on it and you\u2019ll notice everyone parroting the same phrases. Seemingly everyone has a \u201cproven track record for delivering results\u201d and a \u201cbelief in integrated solutions\u201d (one of those buzz phrases that makes less sense the more you think about it. Doesn\u2019t everyone have a belief in integrated solutions? Or are there some people out there thinking: \u201cI personally hate joined-up thinking\u201d). Others have an emotive, possibly too-much-information story to share (\u201cI failed my exams at school, got married young, got divorced young, but now I work at Google and have a spicy girlfriend\u201d), and many want to \u201creach out\u201d \u2013 please, no touching in the workplace! \u2013 to discuss unnamed \u201copportunities\u201d.\nNow, you may be reading this thinking: \u201cWho cares? Let them have their space and stay off the platform if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d And ordinarily, I might agree. But then I watched my brilliant friend \u2013 my accomplished, talented friend \u2013 crumble in the face of it. Her journey has been non-linear: market stalls to magazines, counselling training and now HR. In my view, her work experience is diverse, rich and what makes her excellent at her job, but it doesn\u2019t fit neatly in the boxes of LinkedIn. It upset her to try to upload her life into this format \u2013 where dates had to be applied and money assigned (how do you get around the mandatory \u201cadd date\u201d for the experience of motherhood and informal childcare in your neighbourhood? Are you \u201cfreelancing\u201d if you organise community art events for nothing but a sense of civic pride?). She felt uncomfortable trading in grandiose statements of \u201cpersonal transformation\u201d, even though she has been on more of a journey than many users on the platform. But job vacancy adverts increasingly say \u201capply with your LinkedIn\u201d, and everyone in her field has joined the Stepford employees. I can see why she felt this is what she had to do \u2013 that employers would look for it, and she needed to be there; that if she didn\u2019t compete, she\u2019d be left behind.\nMuch has been written about how tech is changing how we see ourselves and each other. Instagram pushing unattainable beauty standards and lifestyles, Facebook fake news chipping away at people\u2019s belief in institutions, an X format that reduces a complex thought to 280 characters (no wonder nuance is impossible!), turning all of us into outrage addicts. Dating apps have commodified and gamified those most human phenomena: love and desire. Yet somehow LinkedIn has been left out of the spotlight. But here\u2019s my contention: I think it is doing something to us, shifting how we see our accomplishments, what we assign value to and what we don\u2019t. And perhaps most chilling of all, it promotes the idea that we are all just brands, and we must always \u2013 always \u2013 be selling. Apparently, LinkedIn is now being used as a full social network, a place where people talk about their marriages, make friends and maybe even date. What does that tell us about our lives outside work? Do we even still have lives outside work at all?\nPerhaps what is needed is a bit of real and refreshing honesty on LinkedIn. What could it look like, I wonder? I\u2019ll go first.\nHello, I am Coco. I have a proven track record of not responding to text messages in a timely manner. I am a strategic thought leader, in that I have thoughts and I sometimes let them lead me, but not always.

Thatcher\u2019s legacy, right to buy, is a failure, 26 March). Putting it bluntly, it was a brilliant way for the Conservatives to bribe a large sector of mainly Labour voters to switch.\nThe significant discounts offered made buying one\u2019s council house a huge bargain. What is more, in terms of housing provision, it did not benefit the sitting tenants as much as giving a substantial gift to their children, who often provided the initial capital knowing that they would inherit the house and make a big gain on its sale or on its subsequent letting for profit.\nIn cities like my own, with a large stock of council houses, their councils found that right to buy was mainly taken up by those in better areas and on the fringe of more problem estates, and they were left with properties to let in more difficult areas. One direct effect was to reduce greatly the opportunity for existing tenants to obtain transfers to better or more appropriate houses for their needs, and this produced much distress and bitterness among such\u00a0individuals.\nThe policy was a cynical and electorally successful way of abusing public funds for political ends.Michael MeadowcroftFormer Leeds city councillor\n I was brought up at the edge of Dogsthorpe, a large council estate in Peterborough built in the 1950s to house workers in the nearby engineering factories. Council housing had one huge advantage: it allowed local authorities to decide who lived where. Applicants were placed on priority lists based on size of family and need, and houses were allocated accordingly.\nThe right-to-buy scheme has meant that many of those houses are now in the hands of private landlords, and what local authority housing is left is insufficient and fragmented. Had council housing still been in existence, the private rental sector would have been smaller and less significant.\nCouncil housing allowed the state (local councils) more control over housing. That control has now largely gone, and the phrase \u201cclosing the stable door after the horse has bolted\u201d comes to mind.Toby WoodPeterborough\n Keir Starmer, in refusing to scrap right to buy in England, leaves himself the option to extend it to tenants of private landlords.

But now they\u2019ve come unstuck ", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "teaser": "Claims of a leadership bid are \u2018bonkers\u2019, say Penny Mordaunt\u2019s allies. But so too is staying silent while the PM stumbles towards an election", "published": "Mon 18 Mar 2024 17.04 CET", "content": "There are many good reasons for Rishi Sunak to postpone a general election. All are about reducing his party\u2019s potential loss of seats. There is also an overwhelming reason for calling one now. It is in the national interest.\nBritish government needs an act of cleansing. It needs renewal and a fresh start under a new regime. Every month that start is delayed has a cost in decisions postponed. The presumed next government of Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is waiting and ready to go. Its learning curve will be steep and its climb hard. There is not the remotest national advantage in another six months of bickering and squabbling.\nAffliction descends weekly on Sunak\u2019s head. He has shown himself to be an honest and articulate prime minister during probably the toughest episode in modern British politics. But his party and his government machine have failed him. The Rwanda bill, questionable donors, bankrupt councils, tax cuts, extremism laws and defence spending tumble out of Downing Street in a chaotic shambles.\nNow he must confront an alleged plot to replace him with Penny Mordaunt, the apparent favourite of Tory moderates, who several MPs claim has been \u201con manoeuvres\u201d for several months. While Mordaunt herself has not commented publicly, her supporters have called the claims \u201cbonkers\u201d \u2013 and such a bid would indeed be destabilising, just when Sunak most needs support.\nMordaunt is currently leader of the House of Commons. She heads the central oligarchy of power in Britain, the party of government in parliament. Of all cabinet members, her duty is one of absolute loyalty to her leader. Yet she and others remain silent as Sunak trips and stumbles from one calamity to another. Parliamentary lobby journalists gaily disseminate challenges to his leadership. His enemies mostly remain anonymous and, for all we know, may not exist, while his named supporters make the most obvious remark: that a fourth leadership contest in five years would indicate a party unfit for a minute longer in government.\nThroughout Conservative history, the party\u2019s unity has been cited as its secret weapon, manifest as loyalty to the leader of the day. There have been two occasions postwar when it has been as hard-pressed as now. One was in 1964 under Alec Douglas-Home and the other in 1997 under John Major. In both cases, the leader was challenged, respectively by Enoch Powell and by the anti-EU \u201cbastards\u201d. But come election time, loyalty held. The party went dignified into opposition and leadership hopefuls bided their time.\nThere is no dignity now. Mordaunt is a modern politician who, like Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, can fill a room and please a crowd. She did not seem to merit cabinet promotion, other than briefly, over the past troublesome years, as defence secretary for 85 days. She is of the populist rather than executive stream of British politician.\nThis could be a strength, if she were ever to make a leadership bid, but Tory leaders including Margaret Thatcher have been careful to surround themselves with a tight cabal of ministerial talent. It was Johnson\u2019s mass expulsion of such talent in 2019 \u2013 fearing for his position \u2013 that has left the party so denuded of leadership ability today. The deplorable state of the cabinet machine during the pandemic is the one message of the otherwise useless Covid inquiry.\nAs the political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville declared, every political party in Britain is essentially a club. Its ability to act in unison is its greatest strength. That is why Britain has always found it impossible to devolve real power to national or local governments. But the club demands its members obey the rules. One of the great strengths of the historical Labour party was to adapt the discipline of the trade union to parliament.\nThe Tories have suffered factional splits in recent decades, variously into the Referendum, Brexit, UK Independence and Reform parties. The Conservative party has survived them all, admittedly with help from the first-past-the-post system. The present challenge from Reform looks superficially serious, though its former leader, Nigel Farage, is carefully biding his time. Who knows \u2013 but his future may yet be with the Tories.\nThe clear possibility hovers on the horizon of a Farage-Johnson-Mordaunt \u201cred wall\u201d coalition. It could relaunch a \u201cNew Tory\u201d party \u2013 on the model of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour \u2013 amid the putative ruins of a Starmer government. What is different today is the lack of any critical mass of respectable Toryism to offer it resistance. At the prospect of such a future we can only tremble.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "A revolution in the way Britain does politics has begun in Devon. Tory MPs should be afraid", "author": "George Monbiot", "teaser": "There\u2019s an urgent need for a fairer electoral system \u2013 and if politicians won\u2019t make it happen, the people will", "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "This is what democracy looks like: hundreds of people queueing in the rain, seeking to take back control of a political system that treats voters like an afterthought. Last weekend, a remarkable democratic experiment reached its first conclusion. A process that began here in South Devon and is now spreading to other constituencies has allowed voters to reclaim the initiative from centralised and self-interested political parties. It directly confronts our unfair electoral system.\nOurs is one of many constituencies in the UK known as \u201cprogressive tragedies\u201d: places in which most people vote for parties to the left of the Tories but which, thanks to our iniquitous first-past-the-post system, end up with Tory representatives. The Conservatives have ruled here since 1924, often without majority support.\nThe Labour and Conservative leaderships conspire to sustain this system, in the hope of absolute majorities. But it works, like other such truncations of democracy (think of our political funding arrangements) much better for the Conservatives than it does for Labour. As Neal Lawson of the democracy campaign Compass argues, of the 11 general elections since 1979, \u201ceight were won by the Conservative party and only three by Labour. But cooperation among progressive parties could have averted all eight Conservative majority governments bar 2015.\u201d\nBoth within the Labour party and in the country at large, there\u2019s an urgent desire for a fairer system. Unfortunately, this desire is thwarted by the Labour leadership. The result? As Lawson points out, of the 15 wealthy nations surveyed by the ParlGov project, voters in the UK are the most left-leaning, yet suffer the most rightwing governments. Sometimes it seems that Labour strategists would rather possess control than power.\nThis is not going to change in the near future. All pleas to work for the greater good, even when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, have been met with stony refusal. As someone well-placed in the party told me, our undemocratic system, and the prospect it offers of gaining an absolute majority, \u201cis like the ring in Lord of the Rings. You know it harms you, but once it\u2019s within your grasp, you can\u2019t give it up.\u201d\nThe simple and brilliant idea of a group of people in the South Devon constituency was to take these decisions out of the hands of the parties and return them to the people. The UK\u2019s first \u201cpeople\u2019s primary\u201d involved seven meetings held around the constituency. Candidates for progressive or vaguely progressive parties were invited to explain to voters why they would be best placed to evict the Conservative. After each meeting, constituents voted by secret ballot to choose their champion. When the aggregate result was announced, everyone in the constituency could see who other people believed was the most promising challenger.\nWithout this help, we have to guess other people\u2019s voting intentions, and we often guess wrong. The people\u2019s primary overcomes the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, ensuring we are less likely to waste our vote. The decision the constituents make doesn\u2019t prevent the other parties from standing. But, by selecting a common champion, it reduces the chances of letting the Tory back in.\nLabour, thrown into chaos by the leadership\u2019s attempt to control their choice of candidates, has yet to field a contender, so was unable to participate. The party leadership would have blocked its involvement anyway. Their loss. The Liberal Democrat and Green candidates battled gamely across two weeks of meetings. The Lib Dem, Caroline Voaden, won decisively. So now we know that our best chance of helping to eject the dismal Tory MP is to vote for her.\nI chaired the first of these meetings. Tickets sold out two days after they were issued. The questions were searching and pertinent. Whatever the results at the general election, this is already a victory of sorts: bringing people back into the political process, showing how democracy could become a living proposition, rather than a dry and curling parchment locked behind a portcullis with chains.\nNow the process has begun in five other constituencies, including those represented by Kemi Badenoch and Danny Kruger. The South Devon pioneers have identified 57 progressive tragedies in which the Conservatives are still predicted to win and there is some uncertainty about who the most effective challenger is likely to be. They\u2019ve offered to share their model with these constituencies, but not with those where one progressive contender is clearly ahead of the others. In those cases they recommend a different system: stopthetories.vote.\nAll the big political parties hate these primaries. The Tory response is understandable: they know they can\u2019t survive a fair democratic process in a progressive constituency. Most shocking and self-destructive has been the reaction of Liberal Democrat party managers. After the South Devon process had begun, a letter to candidates from the Lib Dem chair in England instructed them: \u201cUnder no circumstances are you to take part \u2026 any candidate who ignores this instruction, and participates in a primary, risks having their approved status rescinded and the withdrawal of party support and resources.\u201d\nThe letter revealed an almost comical misunderstanding of what the primary process is and how it is conducted. It claimed that the primary could put candidates in breach of election law on both process and expenses. In reality, the process has been closely scrutinised by the Electoral Commission, and applies a long list of safeguarding rules. The spending (which is very small, as the primaries are created and run by volunteers) takes place before the champion is chosen, so, as the Electoral Commission has confirmed, doesn\u2019t eat into the candidates\u2019 capped election budgets. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by such reactions: any process involving a transfer of control, however beneficial, will be fiercely opposed by those who are losing it.\nOut of adversity comes better tactics. The Isle of Wight East constituency, after the refusal of both Labour and the Lib Dems to play, is designing a new process that doesn\u2019t rely on their involvement.\nThe primaries won\u2019t deliver a perfect system. We\u2019ll still be stuck with a centralised and coercive politics, unmatched to the needs of the complex system we call society, based on the illegitimate concepts of presumed consent and remote decision-making. We will properly reclaim that power only when our representative politics are accompanied by participatory and deliberative decision-making.\nBut it\u2019s a start: a small, slow revolution in a country whose people have long been deprived of their democratic rights. Enough of command and control. Enough of tricks and truncations. Enough of lies and evasions.

Plus letters from a pensioner who was evicted after asking his landlord to fix damp problems, Daniel Carter and Martyn Williams", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.35 CET", "content": "Nick Bano makes a compelling argument that discussions about increasing the housing supply are misguided if their aim is to fix the UK housing crisis (The end of landlords: the surprisingly simple solution to the UK housing crisis, 19 March). His\u00a0data and succinct description of\u00a0the historical context are consistent with qualitative and quantitative evidence provided by\u00a0various UK housing scholars.\nAs part of my work as a computational economist, I try to understand the connections between housing wealth inequality and the set of incentives that are shaped by institutions such as the market and the government, ie \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d. For this purpose, I develop artificial intelligence models consisting of a computational representation of every household and property in the economy (with their most relevant characteristics and behaviours), and the rules of the game that incentivise them to engage in interactions such as purchasing and renting real estate.\nThese \u201cdigital twins\u201d of the UK housing market generate data that are consistent with official statistics, so one can simulate detailed policy interventions that, in the real world, would be impossible to test under constrained time and financial\u00a0resources.\nBano\u2019s arguments resonate with a study where I find that increasing the housing stock would be a poor choice of intervention if the policy target was reducing housing wealth inequality. However, and contrasting with Bano\u2019s view on a simple solution, my research suggests that housing policy interventions would need to be rather nuanced, well-timed and carefully coordinated, for example, by considering regional differences, target populations, financial incentives, income sources, and how taxes are instrumented. Many of these factors are indeed addressed by commentators, policymakers and academics, but\u00a0in a scattered manner.\nPerhaps it is time to bring these different perspectives together through the analytic prowess of AI methods to scrutinise policy proposals and formulate holistic solutions to one of the most pressing and complex socioeconomic issues in Britain.Dr Omar A GuerreroHead of computational social\u00a0science research, The Alan Turing Institute\n The collapse of landlordism is indeed a noble aim whose achievement would remove one of the biggest factors in social deprivation and inequality in the UK. But as a former tenant who has just been evicted under section 21, the so-called no-fault eviction law, I believe we need to recognise the bigger picture, the wider vested interests in maintaining the system of injustice and exploitation that underpins our housing crisis.\nMy wife and I are pensioners evicted for daring to ask our landlord to fix damp, mould and rain coming into our home.\nWe had plenty of things to say in court to defend ourselves against eviction, not just the landlord\u2019s criminal negligence in failing to maintain the property in a safe, habitable state, but the debt collection agency thug hired by the landlord\u2019s insurance company to terrorise us in our home to make us leave. We have never been in rent arrears by so much as a penny. We were not allowed to mention a word of this in court and were duly\u00a0forced into expensive temporary accommodation by the arrival of the bailiffs.\nThere is a vast empire of dishonest and unscrupulous operators helping to drive up homelessness and trap millions in miserable, unsafe housing. It includes landlords in parliament supporting blatantly unfair laws, big legal and insurance firms, unprincipled lawyers and the courts. The landlords are just the\u00a0tip of the\u00a0iceberg.Name and address supplied\n I was delighted to see that someone is finally talking about the elephant in the room in regard to our housing crisis, and that it has a name: landlordism. Far too much political energy has been wasted discussing damaging and dead-end housing policies like building all over the green belt, pushing up prices with \u201chelp to buy\u201d, or punishing council housing tenants with spare bedrooms.\nMy own family lived in several private rented sector properties in an expensive area for 15 years before we were finally offered (also very expensive) social housing. Based on an average rent of around \u00a31,100 per month over that period, we lined the pockets of our landlords to the tune of almost \u00a3200,000 \u2013 money earned through our own hard work and that of the taxpayers who fund housing benefit.\nSurely the answer is to create straighforward disincentives to owning property simply in order to make easy money from other people\u2019s effort. How hard is it to pass a law abolishing six-month contracts and no-fault evictions? How about taxing the passive wealth earned by landlords? Why is it taboo to discuss rent controls? It might be enough to make them sell up and earn an honest living.Daniel CarterCambridge\n I am what you might call a good landlord, reasonable and caring and not what I would term greedy. There are many like me. I keep my houses in good order and look after my tenants. There is a fair amount of social housing in an appalling condition, so how can the solution be to take all rented housing into the state and charitable sector?\nWould it not be better to root out all examples of unsafe and unhealthy housing in whichever sector, rather than penalise one over the other? Fair rents, yes.

{"headline": "The left is smeared as the angry mob again and again. In reality, it is the target of political violence", "author": "Andy Beckett", "teaser": "These threats don\u2019t just seek to intimidate leftwing politicians, it makes them seem a risk to voters, too", "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 11.00 CET", "content": "In Britain and other supposedly calm democracies, the ascent of leftwing politicians can arouse unusual fears of violence. Many conservatives and centrists associate the left with mobs, intimidation and revolutionary struggle. For some on the right, leftwing politics of any sort is a kind of violence, with the upsetting of the traditional order that it promises.\nSuch fears are not always groundless. But more often they are exaggerated, sometimes deliberately, in order to smear the left as fanatical and dangerous. In reality, the left always contains plenty of pacifists and other principled opponents of the use of force \u2013 life\u2019s \u201cherbivores\u201d, as the writer Michael Frayn called them in a perceptive 1963 essay.\nInstead, what violence there is around the left, whether rhetorical or real, is often directed the other way, against the left\u2019s own representatives. \u201cShe should be shot,\u201d concluded the Tory mega-donor Frank Hester\u2019s horrible rant against Diane Abbott, who after 37 years as an MP remains one of the best-known socialists in the country.\nHester\u2019s racism and misogyny have rightly received huge condemnation. Yet less attention has been paid to the extremity of what he said he wanted to happen to Abbott, and less still to the effect of such violent fantasies on the left as a whole. Is talk of violence against the left just an expression of conservative anger, nasty but with no serious political consequences, or is it something more?\nProminent British socialists have always received death threats. Tony Benn got them regularly throughout his decades as an MP, particularly in the 1970s and 80s when he seemed about to acquire significant power as a minister or Labour deputy leader. Sometimes the threats were sent to his wife, Caroline. \u201cWe regret that your husband is going to be killed and that you will be a widow, but it is in the public interest,\u201d said one letter in 1975, which claimed to be from a group of businessmen called the Defenders of Private Enterprise.\nWell-known leftwingers have been physically assaulted. In 1981, Ken Livingstone, the then leader of the radical Greater London Council, was grabbed and sprayed in the face with red paint. In 2019, Jeremy Corbyn had an egg smashed on his head by a Brexit supporter. Such incidents have generally been treated by the media as minor, almost meaningless. Yet they form part of an ominous pattern. Shortly after the egg-smashing, a video appeared on Twitter (now X) of British soldiers in Afghanistan using a poster of Corbyn for target practice. In 2017, a man from Cardiff with far-right views, Darren Osborne, drove a rented van into a crowd near a mosque in Corbyn\u2019s constituency, killing one man. Osborne had originally planned to kill the Labour leader himself.\nFor the politicians targeted, this mixture of serious threats, actual attacks and hostile play-acting can be intimidating, anxiety-inducing or just depressing. In his diaries, Benn often tried to brush off the death threats as ridiculous rightwing fantasies. But sometimes he admitted to being deeply unsettled. In 1981, the New Statesman printed a story about an alleged plan to kill him two years earlier, involving the Tory MP and close ally of Margaret Thatcher, Airey Neave, and a former MI6 agent, Lee Tracey. Benn later saw Tracey on an episode of Panorama about the security services, and recorded that he felt as if \u201cI was watching my potential assassin. It was a very strange feeling.\u201d No inquiry into the alleged plot followed.\nBeyond the individual victims, the broader effect of violence against the left, whether real or rhetorical, is to make leftwing politicians seem a risk. If you elect them, and especially if they gain positions of national power, violence may follow, voters are in effect warned. As British politics has become more confrontational since the mid-2010s, a wider range of MP\u2019s have become targets, most horribly the centre-left Labour MP Jo Cox and the Tory MP David Amess. But the left remains a favourite target. Along with Abbott, one of those in parliament receiving the most violent abuse is the young leftwinger Zarah Sultana.\nAs much as it\u2019s possible to identify the perpetrators in an era of easily anonymised social media, most of the threats appear to come from the political fringes. Yet the main beneficiaries of this climate of fear may turn out to be centrist, relatively bland and therefore less provocative politicians \u2013 however much they themselves may genuinely be appalled by political violence.\nThis is a country where many voters and political journalists revere \u201cmoderates\u201d and dislike \u201cextremists\u201d, especially those on the left. It can be argued that the threat of violence against radical MPs acts as another form of political discipline, keeping rebellious figures such as Abbott isolated and on the margins, where only the bravest fellow MPs are prepared to join them.\nBritain\u2019s self-image as a peaceful place, however much violence it has visited on other countries, and however much violence is in its own history, means that the role of violence in its politics is usually played down. To look into threats against leftwing MPs, like showing an interest in the threats to our democracy from rightwing authoritarians in the 70s and more recently, is to risk being seen as paranoid, ghoulish, a bit obsessive.\nYet as the Hester episode shows, violent sentiments can be expressed by people very close to power, seemingly without serious consequences for their political and commercial activities. Meanwhile, peaceful protesters are increasingly sent to prison. Where a country draws the line between acceptable and unacceptable politics is always very telling.\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But little hope is still hope. When I read Owen Jones\u2019s article my heart sank, and I fear facing another five years staring into the austere blue abyss (The Labour party is in my blood. Here\u2019s why I\u2019ve just cancelled my membership, 21 March). Is Jones really helping? He\u2019s made it clear in his article and video that voting for what feels like our only option to end Tory rule is a terrible idea. Despite his optimistic attempt to promote vague alternatives to Labour, I feel more cynical.\nIn every election I have voted in, the Conservatives have always won. They\u2019re good at winning. The first time I think my Labour vote could be used to oust them, Jones tries to convince us not to bother.\nUp against millions more pounds in campaign funding, and constituency boundary changes, I\u2019m not confident Labour has this one in the bag. Though the Greens care deeply about our planet\u2019s future survival and some independents are seeking power for the people, splitting the left-leaning vote is not practical. Starmer-branded boring practicality is the best hope we have against a populist government rushing to the extreme right. Clarice Francis London\n Owen Jones recommends that people who think that Labour has somehow betrayed them should support the Greens or independents at the next election. While voting for one of these candidates might well assuage his own personal moral outrage at Labour\u2019s supposed failings, these groups are never likely to form a government, but could well damage Keir Starmer\u2019s chance of securing a parliamentary majority. So, the questions is: would he, and those who think like him, prefer to have another five years of the Tory party smashing up what\u2019s\u00a0left of the welfare state?Richard EllisStoke-on-Trent\n Owen Jones\u2019s article strikes a resonant chord. What is the point of being in government if the Labour party does nothing in office to move forward the lot of the less privileged members of society? Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies may have failed to sway the electorate, but they did show positive and progressive intent and a direction of travel that appealed to a great many.\nI\u2019ve just returned from an evening at the National Theatre celebrating the achievement of Aneurin Bevan, the leading architect and inspiration for the NHS. While celebrating its foundation, the play also eloquently makes the case for nursing the NHS back to health. The Labour party must show real leadership and devise policies that truly inspire. Philip Huggett London\n Like Owen Jones, I too am dismayed by the dismantling of Labour party values and beliefs. Now 74 years old, I too was a lifelong supporter and member of the party, a working-class girl raised by a single mother who believed, as I do, in shared support and care in society. I have two of her paintings of the Jarrow March on the wall of my home. I have been called many things, from \u201cmisguided\u201d to \u201cdangerous\u201d, because of my views.\nI resigned my membership of the party when it became clear after the EU referendum that they would never raise the flag of opposition and change.

{"headline": "The Labour party is in my blood. Here\u2019s why I\u2019ve just cancelled my membership ", "author": "Owen Jones", "teaser": "My ancestors had their own complex relationships with the party, but they could point to policies that transformed people\u2019s lives. In 2024, I cannot say the same", "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "It\u2019s difficult to disentangle Labour from my sense of self. Grew up in Stockport, looks a bit like Macaulay Culkin, bad dress sense \u2026 the Labour party always seemed to fit in there somewhere. My great-grandfather, a railwayman who had his wages docked in the General Strike nearly a century ago, was a Labour councillor. So was my grandmother; her proudest achievement was stopping a family being evicted by a private landlord over Christmas. My parents met at an open-air Labour meeting outside Tooting Bec in the 1960s (romantic). My mother bought me a Labour membership as a 15th birthday present. Under every Labour leader in my 21 years of adult life, I\u2019ve plumped for the party\u2019s candidates at local, national and European level, and campaigned for them to boot.\nAnd yet, after a uniquely calamitous 14-year stretch of Tory rule, just as Labour looks set to reconquer No 10 by a landslide, I\u2019ve just emailed the party cancelling my membership. My committed critics will understandably seek to link the two: Labour has shed its aversion to electability, and off sulks Home Alone\u2019s patron saint of unelectable ideas.\nBut my decision isn\u2019t based on a desire to see Labour for ever in the wilderness. Reaching it has been a gradual, painful process of realising the party won\u2019t even do the bare minimum to improve people\u2019s lives, or to tackle the crises that have led Britain to catastrophe; and that it will, in fact, wage war on anyone who wants to do either\u2013 making anyone with politics to the left of Peter Mandelson feel like a pariah on borrowed time. Yes, my relatives had conflicted relationships with the party, and were often frustrated by its insufficient radicalism. But they could always point to policies that transformed the lives of the people Labour was founded to represent, from the welfare state to the minimum wage and the NHS, where my grandmother worked for her whole life.\nThe premise of Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership bid in 2020 was that popular policies such as taxing the rich to invest in public services, scrapping tuition fees and promoting public ownership were not to blame for the party\u2019s 2019 electoral rout. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s 2017 election manifesto, Starmer declared, was the party\u2019s \u201cfoundational document\u201d \u2013 centred around such commitments and credited with the party\u2019s biggest surge in vote share since 1945, even if it wasn\u2019t enough to win two years after a shattering defeat. \u201cJeremy Corbyn made our party the party of anti-austerity,\u201d Starmer told shattered Labour members, \u201cand he was right to do so.\u201d Though I didn\u2019t vote for him, his pitch gave hope for the broad church my ancestors believed in. In response, I wrote a column titled: \u201cStarmer can succeed, and he deserves our support.\u201d\nYet five years on, Labour has become a hostile environment for anyone believing in the very policies Starmer relied upon to secure the leadership. Sure, Tony Blair\u2019s leadership bid didn\u2019t include laying waste Iraq, but he didn\u2019t pretend to be a slicker version of Tony Benn either. \u201cCircumstances changed,\u201d plead Starmer\u2019s defenders. Weird, then, that according to Margaret Hodge, she was led to believe by a Starmer ally during the leadership election that he was \u201clying\u201d in order to get the job. Weird, too, that during that same campaign Starmer told Andrew Neil that nationalisation of utilities would feature in a Labour manifesto, but 18 months later said: \u201cI never made a commitment to nationalisation.\u201d\nAh, the luxury of a Guardian columnist, goes the predictable retort, demanding the most vulnerable pay the price for his lofty principles. Consider, though, that ending the two-child benefit cap would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, and lessen the effects of poverty on a further 850,000, but Starmer backed keeping it anyway. Why? To sound tough, presumably. On who? Impoverished children, like those I grew up with in Stockport? This is the same Labour party that has ruled out bringing back a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses or instituting a wealth tax. The same Labour party committed to Tory fiscal rules that lock the country into dismal austerity policies that have delivered collapsing public services and an unprecedented decline in living standards. The same Labour party that gutted its one distinctive flagship policy, a \u00a328bn-a-year green investment fund, not because it came under pressure, but because it feared it might.\nSome argue that Labour is doing a Clark Kent, and will unveil its hidden progressive Superman upon assuming office. Yet those fiscal rules make that approach impossible, even if you disregard the propensity of Labour governments to become more rightwing in office.\nThe assault on Gaza, the great crime of our age, adds moral indecency to the pile of dishonesty and vacuity. When Starmer declared Israel had the right to cut off energy and water to Palestinian civilians, he did so as a human rights lawyer who understands the Geneva conventions. After letting shadow cabinet ministers defend him, he claimed it \u201chas never been my view that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines\u201d. We all have political red lines: mine is supporting what would amount to war crimes against innocent civilians, toddlers and newborn babies among them, then gaslighting the public over doing so.\nWhere is my gratitude for Starmer delivering a now inevitable landslide victory, you may ask? Well, he didn\u2019t force Boris Johnson and his cronies to violate their own pandemic rules, or to trash the NHS, or oversee the worst squeeze in living standards in history. Nor did he propel to power Liz Truss, whose unhinged economic experiment crashed the economy \u2013 the moment when the electorate turned on this Tory party for good.\nThe absolute power a landslide victory will give Labour should scare you. When Starmer allies deployed antisemitic tropes \u2013 with one joking about a \u201crun on silver shekels\u201d when two Jewish businessmen missed out on peerages, and another calling a Jewish Tory donor a \u201cpuppet master\u201d \u2013 an apology was deemed to be sufficient. When another racially abused a journalist and had a sexual harassment complaint upheld, they were reinstated after investigation.\nContrast this with Diane Abbott, Britain\u2019s first Black female MP, who was suspended after immediately apologising for an Observer letter in which she argued that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people are not subject to racism \u201call their lives\u201d. She has been left in limbo for 10 months and counting while the party investigates \u2013 only for Labour to use the racist abuse directed at her by a Tory donor for political capital, while still refusing to reinstate her.\nAnother fellow leftwinger, Kate Osamor \u2013 again, a Black female MP \u2013 was suspended for describing the assault on Gaza as a genocide on the day the international court of justice placed Israel on trial for alleged genocide. Questions of racism, then, seem to be judged on whether they have a factional use \u2013 a sure sign of moral bankruptcy. This leadership style is crude in opposition; with an overwhelming majority, it will be chilling.\nThat is why I think those who believe in real change from the Tories\u2019 bankrupt model should vote for Green or independent candidates. A new initiative \u2013 We Deserve Better \u2013 is raising money to support such candidates, judged on whether they believe in, say, taxing the well-off to invest, or public ownership, or opposing war crimes, even if they differ on this or that. Those seeking transformative policies are now fragmented, but they don\u2019t have to be. The premise of this new initiative is simple: if the left doesn\u2019t band together, the only pressure on Labour will come from the migrant-bashing, rich-worshipping right.\nThe Tories\u2019 chance of winning is infinitesimally small. What matters now is whether anyone who wants to redistribute wealth and power is denied a voice in Starmer\u2019s administration. That is certainly the ambition of his lieutenants. When inevitable disillusionment with a government rooted in deceit and lacking any solutions to Britain\u2019s woes seeps in, it will be the radical right that stands to benefit.\nSo bid me farewell, even cry \u201cgood riddance\u201d, but before you do, ask yourself: what do you think will happen next?\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\nGuardian Newsroom: What is Labour\u2019s plan? On Tuesday 16 April, 8pm\u20139.15pm BST, join Gaby Hinsliff, Tom Baldwin, Polly Toynbee and Kiran Stacey as they discuss the ideas and the events that might shape Labour in power.

{"headline": "Does China spy on Britain? Of course. But we have more important things to discuss with them", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "teaser": "While diplomatic rows are inevitable, the priority is to keep channels open,  and engage with Beijing about the climate crisis", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "Once upon a time Britain would have sent a gunboat up the Yangtze River. That would teach those Chinese a lesson. To hear some MPs talk about Beijing\u2019s espionage activities, you would think gunboats were already on their way.\nOf course, it is malicious and hurtful for a foreign state patently to hack into Britain\u2019s Electoral Commission and target senior parliamentarians \u2013 as the government on Monday claimed China did in 2021. It is equally malicious to fabricate MPs\u2019 emails and use a Commons researcher as an informant. No less evil is the culture of fear sown among Britain\u2019s 150,000 Chinese students by agents of Beijing, albeit tolerated by British universities greedy for money.\nHow to react is another matter. Rishi Sunak was quick to the fray. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that the situation now is that China is behaving in an increasingly assertive way abroad, authoritarian at home, and it represents an epoch-defining challenge, and also the greatest state-based threat to our economic security,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s right that we take measures to protect ourselves, which is what we are doing.\u201d That was clear. It was also ridiculous. On Sunday night, an equally absurd BBC political bubble programme, the Westminster Hour on Radio 4, seemed to regard war as at hand. MPs demanded that the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, \u201ccall out China\u201d, rather as though it had broken a Garrick Club rule. Beijing was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. There should be \u201cconsequences\u201d. The Yangtze gunboat was clearing its decks.\nBut ahead of that, Dowden was indeed having his say. There will be a reckoning, he promised MPs, more sanctions. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, who is said to have been targeted alongside other parliamentarians in the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, was also blunt. China is not just a challenge to us, he said. It must be framed as a threat. \u201cAs they grow in power and potency, we are shrinking before them,\u201d he said.\nStill, I doubt if this gets even a news-in-brief in the People\u2019s Daily. Britain\u2019s parliament cannot be a big deal in the hierarchy of Beijing security. The fulminations of Duncan Smith will hardly have had the People\u2019s Liberation Army straining at the leash. It is sound and fury, much like at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when any British minister meeting a Chinese host was told always \u201cto raise issues concerning Uyghur human rights\u201d. A Chinese acquaintance told me it became comical, \u201clike the Brits saying grace or asking about the weather\u201d.\nBritish diplomacy still exists in a mist of lost imperial power. China, meanwhile, is expanding its global influence exactly as the west once did. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) now extends across Asia, Africa and Europe. Its investments have advanced China\u2019s interests but also the lives of those it assists. BRI has, incidentally, been much to the gain of the City of London, in construction, banking, insurance and professional services. Realpolitik is how it works. The fate of the Uyghurs never stopped David Cameron and George Osborne begging for Chinese cash for power stations and railways; business was business.\nToday the world\u2019s relations with China are in one area crucial. That country is responsible for more than a quarter of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and rising. Britain is now actively participating in China\u2019s proposed \u201cgreening\u201d of its BRI programme, which is largely about infrastructure. Given that a third of all greenhouse gas emissions are from construction \u2013 a fact still ignored by British planning policy \u2013 this collaboration with China is central to fighting the climate crisis. It is not about diplomatic posturing. It is about something essential.\nThe reality is that all states spy on each other, mostly to no effect and at vast cost. Nothing justifies hacking other people\u2019s emails, but a helping of public outrage and a few Chinese diplomats sent packing should be enough to restore Westminster\u2019s machismo. It is also clear that international action is needed to police the darker regions of the digital universe, where the entire world is wandering without a candle.\nBut, for all these concerns, a sense of proportion remains the hardest but most necessary quality to maintain in international relations. We are told daily that global heating is the greatest threat now facing the world. Unless that applies only before lunch, then it should surely lie at the centre of all relations with China.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "In defying Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu is exposing the limits of US power", "author": "Jonathan Freedland", "teaser": "The Israeli PM\u2019s refusal to heed US demands on food aid for Gaza is morally indefensible, hurting the president \u2013  and opening the door to Donald Trump", "published": "Fri 22 Mar 2024 18.41 CET", "content": "The pictures out of Gaza get more harrowing with each passing day. After months of witnessing civilians grieving for loved ones killed by bombs, now we see children desperate to eat \u2013 victims of what the aid agencies and experts are united in calling an imminent \u201cman-made\u201d famine. What matters most about these images is their depiction of a continuing horror inflicted on the people of Gaza. But they also reveal something that could have lasting implications for Israelis and Palestinians, for Americans and for the entire world. What they show, indeed what they advertise, is the weakness of the president of the United States.\nJoe Biden and his most senior lieutenants have been urging Israel to increase the flow of food aid into Gaza for months, in ever more insistent terms. This week the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, cited the finding of a UN-backed agency that the threat of hunger now confronted \u201c100% of the population of Gaza\u201d, adding that this was the first time that body had issued such a warning. Earlier this month, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, told Israel it needed to do whatever it took to get humanitarian aid into Gaza: \u201cNo excuses.\u201d The Biden administration is all but banging the table and demanding Israel act.\nA week ago, it seemed to have had an effect. The Israel Defense Forces announced what was billed as a \u201cdramatic pivot\u201d, promising that it would \u201cflood\u201d Gaza with food supplies. But there\u2019s precious little sign of it. An additional crossing has been opened, the so-called 96th gate, allowing a few more trucks to go in, but nothing on the scale that is required to avert disaster \u2013 or mitigate the disaster already unfolding. For all the talk of a pivot, there is still \u201ca series of impediments, blockages, restrictions \u2026 on lorries carrying the most basic humanitarian aid\u201d, David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee said this week. He noted the way that Israel\u2019s ban on \u201cdual use\u201d items, those things that could be used as weapons if they fell into the hands of Hamas, means that even the inclusion of a simple pair of scissors for a clinic can result in an entire truckful of aid being turned back.\nTo repeat, the victims of this are the 2.2 million people of Gaza, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from. But it represents a severe problem, or several, for Biden too. The most obvious is that he is in a re-election year, seeking to reassemble the coalition that brought him victory in 2020. Back then, a crucial constituency was the young, with voters under 30 favouring Biden over Donald Trump by 25 points. Now it\u2019s a dead heat. To be sure, there are several factors to explain that shift, but one of them is younger Americans\u2019 outrage at the plight of Gaza.\nThe threat to re-election is illustrated most sharply in the battleground state of Michigan, home to 200,000 Arab-Americans who are similarly appalled, with many unequivocal that they will not vote for Biden, even if that risks the return of Trump \u2013 with all that implies for the US and the world. That number is more than enough to tip the state from Democrat to Republican in November. \u201cIf the election were held tomorrow, I think Biden would lose Michigan,\u201d veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told me on the Unholy podcast this week. For Biden, \u201cthis is a pain point\u201d.\nUS support for Israel in this context would be a headache for any Democratic president, but Israel\u2019s willingness to defy its most important ally presses especially on Biden. For one thing, the upside of his great age is supposed to be his experience in foreign affairs and especially his personal relationships with fellow world leaders. He likes to say he has known every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir and that he\u2019s dealt with Netanyahu for decades. Critics reply: a fat lot of good it\u2019s done you.\nAnd that is the heart of the matter. For most of Israel\u2019s history, it\u2019s been taken as read that a clear objection from a US president is enough to make an Israeli prime minister change course. A shake of the head from Dwight Eisenhower brought an end to the Suez war of 1956. A phone call from Ronald Reagan ended the Israeli bombardment of west Beirut in 1982. In 1991, George HW Bush pushed a reluctant Likud prime minister to attend the Madrid peace conference, by withholding $10bn in loan guarantees.\nBiden has repeatedly made his displeasure known, and yet Netanyahu does not budge. It\u2019s making the US look weak and for Biden especially, that\u2019s deadly. \u201cThe subtext of the whole Republican campaign is that the world\u2019s out of control and Biden\u2019s not in command,\u201d David Axelrod, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, told me on Unholy . \u201cThat\u2019s basically their argument, and they use age as a surrogate for weakness.\u201d Every time Netanyahu seems to be \u201cpunking\u201d Biden, says Axelrod, it makes things worse.\nPlenty of Israeli analysts suggest that appearances are deceptive. In their view, Netanyahu is making a great show of thumbing his nose at Biden, because he is in an undeclared election campaign and defiance of Washington plays well with his base, but in reality he is much more compliant. In this reading, Team Netanyahu\u2019s talk of a ground operation in Rafah \u2013 where nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are crammed together, most having fled Israeli bombardment \u2013 is just talk. Yes, the Israeli PM likes to threaten a Rafah invasion, to put pressure on Hamas and to have a bargaining chip with the Americans, but he is hardly acting like a man committed to doing it. Amos Harel, much-respected defence analyst for the Haaretz newspaper, notes that there are only three and a half IDF brigades currently in Gaza, compared with 28 at the height of hostilities. \u201cNetanyahu is in a campaign, and for the time being at least, \u2018Rafah\u2019 is just a slogan,\u201d he told me.\nLet\u2019s hope that\u2019s right, and a Rafah operation is more rhetorical than real. That does not address Israel\u2019s foot-dragging on aid, which Netanyahu is clearly in no hurry to end, in part because his ultranationalist coalition partners believe sending food to Gaza is tantamount to aiding the Hamas enemy.\nThat leaves Biden with two options. His preferred outcome is a breakthrough in the talks in Qatar, which would see both a release of some of the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October and a pause in fighting, allowing aid to flow in. But Netanyahu fears such a pause, which would hasten the day of reckoning for his role in leaving Israel\u2019s southern communities so badly exposed six months ago to Hamas \u2013 whether that reckoning is at the hands of the electorate or a commission of inquiry. He prefers to play for time, ideally until November, when Netanyahu hopes to say goodbye to Biden and welcome back Trump.\nThe alternative for Biden is tougher. Last month, he issued a new protocol, demanding those countries that receive US arms affirm in writing that they abide by international law, including on humanitarian aid. If the US doesn\u2019t certify that declaration, all arms sales stop immediately. In Israel\u2019s case, the deadline for certification is Sunday.\nJoe Biden does not want to be the man who stopped arming Israel, not least because that would leave the country vulnerable to the mighty arsenal of Hezbollah just across the northern border with Lebanon. His administration is split on the move and he may well deem it too much. But he does need to see food flood into Gaza, right away. He has tried asking Netanyahu nicely. Now he needs to get tough.\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "As brutal war rages and famine looms, look at pictures of Gaza and keep saying: \u2018this is not normal\u2019", "author": "Nesrine Malik", "teaser": "Of all the threats to those suffering, one of the most frightening is that we tire \u2013 and their plight becomes background noise", "published": "Mon 25 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "Cast your mind back to early 2022, more than two years ago now. Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was such a shock, such a break with decades of political consensus, that it was treated as an act of aggression that could not for one moment be accepted or made peace with, only urgently rebuffed. Condemnations, lamentations and pledges of support, both for Ukraine\u2019s military effort and its displaced people, all signified the same thing \u2013 this was an aberration that would not be allowed to pass.\nBut pass it did. Russia has since suffered heavy losses and the war is referred to now as a \u201cquagmire\u201d for Putin, but pass it did. US arms support is dwindling, and a sizeable aid package has been stuck, blocked by partisan mischief, in the House of Representatives for months now. Just as striking is how the invasion has become relegated from high news and politics to another item jostling for attention, sympathy and outrage. An obscene banality of war is that if it goes on long enough, life will rearrange around it.\nNow imagine an act of aggression that had no such universal, full-throated condemnation, no pledges of large aid packages and no support or schemes for refugees. In fact, imagine one where the aid and military support is being provided, but it is to the party that is killing civilians and invading their territory. How much harder is it then, to maintain that sense of urgency and outrage? To keep it in the headlines? To keep the pressure up on politicians? To keep it even alive in your heart? It has been almost six months since Israel launched its assault in Gaza. But even as the images of dead children buried in rubble give way to those of dead children emaciated from hunger, there is an unmistakable sense of fade.\nSome of that fade is by design. Why would a matter that raises awkward questions for politicians be kept in the spotlight by those same politicians who have either supported Israel\u2019s actions or dragged their feet in condemning them. The result is not just avoidance, but dilution. The scale of the crisis in Gaza is not brought to us from the lecterns of the US president or his spokespeople, the sort of representatives who (still, jarringly) speak about Russian war crimes and how they must not be tolerated or normalised. On the first anniversary of the Ukraine invasion, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, addressed the United Nations security council and said: \u201cDay after day of Russia\u2019s atrocities, it\u2019s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage. But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal. Bucha is not normal. Mariupol is not normal. Irpin is not normal. Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.\u201d\nGaza is not normal, but you won\u2019t hear Blinken pleading that you not become desensitised to it. Instead it will come from human rights organisations, experts, reporters and aid workers who warn that what amounts to \u201cutter annihilation\u201d is not only exceptional, it is beyond description. But their collective efforts, admirable and credible as they are, catch in a bottleneck when they reach the powers that can do anything about them.\nSo the fact that the assault on Gaza has resulted in the \u201cbiggest cohort of paediatric amputees in history\u201d, or that if things remain as they are, Gaza will fall to \u201cthe most intense famine since the second world war\u201d, will not be acted upon by supporters and underwriters \u2013 both practical and moral \u2013 of Israel\u2019s offensive, beyond what are increasingly farcical requests that the Israeli government behave more reasonably. The volume at which such historic horrors are amplified is always artificially set to one that is much quieter than it should be \u2013 which at this point, is nothing short of at maximum.\nThat silencing also smothers and makes harder the work of those members of the general public who have, for months now, through protest and campaigning, tried to keep that volume as high as it can be; to simply state that this is not normal. But not only is their message being ignored, it is being actively suppressed through attempts to ban protest altogether, or imply relentlessly that it is about something else \u2013 anything else, rather than anger and worry about the fate of those in Gaza. An almost eerie outcome is that as hundreds of thousands pound the streets around the world on a weekly basis and tell their representatives how they feel, their voices are muted, or others speak for them; they become ventriloquist dummies for politicians who present them as parodies of threat and menace.\nThen there is just the fatigue. Fatigue from anger, from being given the run around by politicians, from exposure to events that no human can witness for an extended period of time without some sort of numbing, self-defence impulse kicking in. A double whammy burnout that comes from exposure to scenes and statements, casually posted by Israeli officials or sourced from their own cameras, of unarmed civilians being killed by drone missiles \u2013 but also the silence about them from official parties, even as the footage tears through WhatsApp messages and social media timelines. The problem when unheard-of things happen, is that once they do, they are then heard of.\nBut normalisation also comes from successfully presenting acts of man as acts of God. The more time passes and nothing is done about Gaza, the more it settles in the global conflict pool as something now just too complex (a \u201cquagmire\u201d if you will) to address. And in a way it is an act of nature, in the sense that the political alliances and historical legacies that made it possible are too hardwired to be undone without major disruption to decades-old political, military and racial settlements. How is fatigue not to set in, when one wakes up every day to battle with the geopolitical gods?\nThis is something perpetrators and abettors count on. That there will be a point \u2013 no matter how intense the scrutiny or distress \u2013 when things simply move on through sheer force of human nature, media cycles, and political introversion, especially as decisive elections loom. It feels like the moment when that wager pays off is nearing.\nBut the window of engagement and its global scale have already lasted longer than anyone expected, wrong-footing politicians and frustrating them in their efforts to manage public opinion. And with both a Rafah ground invasion and intense famine looming, the pressure on Israel and its supporters might continue to defy all the political bets.\n Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Our lack of affordable, safe housing is a national crisis. Here are three things Labour can do to fix it", "author": "Peter Apps", "teaser": "If it gets to No 10, the party should fund a social housing boom, tackle homelessness \u2013 and usher in a post-Grenfell era of safety", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 13.00 CET", "content": "The failures in housing policy over several generations are now all too obvious: rising homelessness, families and key workers priced out of cities and a generation unable to move out of their parents\u2019 homes. The next government needs to take radical action to change this picture, rather than make small tweaks to a failed system. These are some of the steps I would take to get there.\nThe next Labour government must break with the idea that we can no longer afford to build new social rented homes, and instead return to the ideals of the postwar consensus, where housing provision was as much a role for the state as health and education.\nDespite towering war debts, in 1953 the UK\u2019s local authorities built 245,000 social rented homes in a single year, which accounted for 75% of all homes built. Last year, there were a shade over 9,500 social rent homes built in England \u2013 just 4% of all homes built.\nWe are not going to go back to 1950s levels of council housebuilding any time soon, but the contrasting figures should at least illustrate that another way is possible. Even a return to the 40,000 social rented homes built in 2010-11 \u2013 a result of New Labour programmes \u2013 or the 57,000 built under a Conservative government in 1993 would make a major difference. The low numbers in recent years are a historical quirk of the post-2010 austerity era, and Labour should consign them to history.\nThe party should realise that higher levels of investment in social housing are necessary to make its big commitment to new towns work and to navigate the current market downturn. Since there is no point turning on the taps with the plug out, Labour should also scrap the right to buy as part of this drive.\nA report last month calculated that investing in 90,000 social homes would repay within 11 years and would generate a \u00a312bn profit for the taxpayer over 30 years. It is time to understand that government borrowing for this sort of investment is wholly different from borrowing for tax cuts, energy bill relief or banking sector bailouts. If rigid fiscal rules preclude this sort of investment, the rules should change.\nOver the past 14 years, the government\u2019s stated housing objective has been to boost home ownership. The result? A steep rise in house prices.\nMeanwhile, the number of households in temporary accommodation in England has soared to 109,000 \u2013 a rise of almost 120% since 2010. On top of this, rough sleeping has risen by 27% in a year, and the number of families presenting to their council as homeless has grown by almost 30,000 in five years.\nLabour should change the state\u2019s housing policy objective from boosting home ownership to relieving and preventing homelessness \u2013 the most obvious and tragic manifestation of our broken system.\nBy promising to be judged on its ability to reduce rough sleeping, the number of families in temporary accommodation and individuals who present to their local authority as homeless, Labour would mark a vital philosophical shift from which better policy would flow.\nThe quickest lever would be to increase the local housing allowance \u2013 the total benefits that can be claimed for housing costs \u2013 back to pre-austerity levels. This would allow councils to rehouse homeless families more easily and allow those in financial stress to keep a roof over their head.\nBut in the longer term, Labour would need to explore western European private rental models, the defining characteristics of which are some form of rent control and long-term security of tenure. It would also mean adopting housing-first models, where rough sleepers are given a home along with further support, which have all but eliminated rough sleeping in Finland.\nThe shocking scenes in Valencia last month, where 10 people died in a tower fire, are the most stark reminder of the urgent need to make our buildings safe. Nearly seven years on from the Grenfell Tower fire, there are still many thousands of buildings around the UK that have major fire safety defects. The residents of these buildings are unable to move on with their lives and it is only luck that has prevented a repeat disaster.\nWhat should have happened in the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell fire, and what Labour must prioritise in government, is a centralised response from the recently created building safety regulator. The next government should beef up its powers, give it a mandate to oversee the removal of dangerous cladding and repair of other defects and ensure that developers, contractors and cladding suppliers are held to account. Tough action should be taken against those dragging their feet.\nFire safety should simply be the first step in a major push to raise safety and quality standards across the whole housing sector, which must also include stronger rights for renters living in disrepair. We also need tougher oversight of construction sites, strong penalties for those who fail to build safe homes and genuine protections for homebuyers. Otherwise the planned expansion of housebuilding will simply be an expansion of the building safety crisis.\nPeter Apps is the author of Show Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell Happen"},
{"headline": "Britain is becoming a toxic chemical dumping ground \u2013 yet another benefit of Brexit", "author": "George Monbiot", "teaser": "Perhaps our government imagines bulldog spirit will protect us from the dangerous substances that Europe rules unsafe", "published": "Mon 18 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "It\u2019s a benefit of Brexit \u2013 but only if you\u2019re a manufacturer or distributor of toxic chemicals. For the rest of us, it\u2019s another load we have to carry on behalf of the shysters and corner-cutters who lobbied for the UK to leave the EU.\nThe government insisted on a separate regulatory system for chemicals. At first sight, it\u2019s senseless: chemical regulation is extremely complicated and expensive. Why replicate an EU system that costs many millions of euros and employs a small army of scientists and administrators? Why not simply adopt as UK standards the decisions it makes? After all, common regulatory standards make trading with the rest of Europe easier. Well, now we know. A separate system allows the UK to become a dumping ground for the chemicals that Europe rules unsafe.\nWhile negotiating our exit from the EU, the government repeatedly promised that environmental protections would not be eroded. In 2018, for example, the then environment secretary Michael Gove, in a speech titled Green Brexit, claimed \u201cnot only will there be no abandonment of the environmental principles that we\u2019ve adopted in our time in the EU, but indeed we aim to strengthen environmental protection measures\u201d. Such pledges turn out to be as dodgy as a \u00a33 coin with Boris Johnson\u2019s head on it.\nOur proudly sovereign regulatory system immediately descended into total chaos: chaos of the kind that the warlord capitalists who backed the leave campaign might have been hoping for. It took the UK\u2019s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) until last month to publish its chemicals regulation work programme for the financial year 2023-2024. That was, erm, six weeks before the period expired. You\u2019ll remember, of course, how Brexit would enable us to escape the \u201cinefficiencies\u201d of Brussels bureaucracy.\nAs the campaign group Chem Trust documents, our shadow version of the EU system, called UK Reach, is beset by underfunding, understaffing, a skills crisis and an impossible workload. It looks to me like the kind of failure-by-design that afflicts so much of environmental regulation in the UK.\nThis dysfunction leaves us exposed to toxins now being banned or restricted in Europe. For example, tetraethyl lead has long been banned from fuel for surface vehicles. But it continues to be used in aircraft fuel, ensuring we are sprayed with a chemical that causes neurological disorders. The EU, after long resisting the obvious step, has at last ruled that it must be phased out. But the UK hasn\u2019t. It will remain legal here. The same goes for endocrine-disrupting chemicals in children\u2019s toys, formaldehyde, brominated flame retardants and the microplastics intentionally added to fertilisers and artificial sport surfaces.\nThe EU is far from perfect. It has backtracked on some of its own commitments. But at least it\u2019s doing something about chemicals that cause cancers and other illnesses and devastate ecosystems. Since we left the bloc, UK regulators have yet to adopt a single new ban or restriction of a harmful substance. Brings a lump to the throat, this patriotic self-reliance, doesn\u2019t it? Or perhaps to the breast, or stomach, or liver.\nIn some respects, we\u2019ve even been spiralling backwards. The government has decided that workplace exposure limits on dimethylformamide, and restrictions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in synthetic sports pitches, of lead in PVC products and of hazardous substances in disposable nappies are \u201cnot a priority for action this year\u201d. Part of its reasoning is that it has yet to see evidence that these substances pose a risk that is \u201cspecific to Great Britain\u201d. Does their use in the UK present different risks to their identical use elsewhere? Perhaps the bulldog spirit of this sceptred isle protects us from chemicals that afflict the lesser beings overseas.\nIn the EU, there is now a total ban on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides \u2013 perhaps better labelled ecocides, thanks to their remarkably wide range of impacts. But every year since we left the EU, the UK government has granted an \u201cemergency\u201d exemption from the supposed ban here, following lobbying by sugar beet producers and the National Farmers Union. In August 2020, British Sugar asked for \u201cno more than three years\u2026 to give us time to develop alternatives\u201d. Given that it granted yet another authorisation in 2024, perhaps the government could ask British Sugar\u2019s managing director how his company is getting along. He shouldn\u2019t be hard to find. He\u2019s married to the health secretary.\nThe more we learn, the more we realise how dangerous chemicals approved without proper testing or consideration can be. New findings, for instance, on the health effects of PFAS compounds \u2013 \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2013 and on the ecological and health impacts of pesticides, and on the effects of microplastics in soil show why we should apply the precautionary principle. By the time we discover that a substance is more hazardous than first believed, it is embedded in our ecosystems, our bodies and our lives.\nWhile the UK government appears incapable of developing new public protections, it is also mysteriously unable, following lobbying, donations and taps on the shoulder, to uphold and enforce the regulations we do possess. Every body that\u2019s supposed to protect us from environmental harm \u2013 such as the Environment Agency or the HSE \u2013 is woefully underfunded, underpowered and demoralised. This is where most deregulation happens: not in the formation or de-formation of rules, which, at least in theory, is subject to parliamentary debate, but in the government\u2019s unwillingness to apply them, which is not.\nThis is why a group of us, called Fighting Dirty, are taking the government to court over its multiple failures to protect people and ecosystems from hazardous chemicals, beginning with its outrageous refusal to test or regulate the many toxins being spread on farmland in sewage sludge. We have just been granted permission for a high court hearing. Such legal actions, difficult and expensive as they are, are a last resort, when regulatory standards and the agencies supposed to uphold them have all but collapsed.\nBrexit was sold to us on the grounds of intangible gains: a sense of autonomy and pride, particularity and independence. These intangible gains are accompanied by tangible losses: real impacts on our health and wellbeing. We might have left the EU, but we did not escape the demands of predatory capital.

{"headline": "There are more than 1,000 varieties of banana, and we eat one of them. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s absurd", "author": "Dan Saladino", "teaser": "The lack of diversity could mean the fruit\u2019s extinction. It offers a stark warning of what could happen to other key foods", "published": "Fri 22 Mar 2024 13.00 CET", "content": "The meeting of the World Banana Forum last week in Rome didn\u2019t make many headlines. But what was under discussion there has serious implications for everyone. The ubiquitous yellow fruit is the proverbial canary in the mine of our modern food system, showing just how fragile it is. And the current plight of the banana should serve as an invitation to us all to become champions of food diversity.\nWhen you peel a banana, you\u2019re on the receiving end of a near-miraculous $10bn supply chain. One that sends seemingly endless quantities of a tropical fruit halfway across the world to be among the cheapest, most readily available products in supermarket aisles (on average, around 12p a banana). But, incredibly, there\u2019s no inbuilt backup plan or safety net if the one variety that most of the global trade depends on starts to fail.\nThe most striking point made at this year\u2019s forum came in a seemingly innocuous comment in the event\u2019s opening speech. The director general of the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation, Dr Qu Dongyu, questioned why, with more than 1,000 known varieties of banana, the world mostly depends on just one, a species called the Cavendish. That needs to change, he said, hinting that we are all part of the problem.\nMost people don\u2019t question why every banana they\u2019ve ever eaten looks and tastes pretty much the same. Most of us will never try a blue java from Indonesia with its soft, unctuous texture and flavour of vanilla ice-cream, or the Chinese banana that is so aromatic it\u2019s been given the name go san heong, meaning \u201cyou can smell it from the next mountain\u201d. The demand for low-cost, high-yielding varieties has resulted in vast monocultures of just one type of globally traded banana, and this is true of many other crops as well. Homogeneity in the food system is a risky strategy, because it reduces our ability to adapt in a rapidly changing world.\nUnlike wild bananas, which grow from seed, every single Cavendish is a clone, the offspring of a slice of the plant\u2019s suckers growing below ground. This means it has no way of evolving, so it can\u2019t adapt to new threats that arise in the environment. Panama disease, also known as fusarium wilt, is whipping through monocultures of Cavendish bananas in Asia, Australia, Africa and, most recently, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the source of 80% of the world\u2019s traded bananas. Just a few spores carried on a spade or even on clothing is all it takes to contaminate a plantation, and growing the Cavendish on that land is no longer an option.\nOne solution in the face of this devastating disease is to use genetic modification or gene-editing to develop bananas with greater resistance. James Dale, a professor at Queensland University of Technology, spent decades working on a modified version of the Cavendish designed to be \u201chighly resistant\u201d to the variant of Panama disease that\u2019s attacking the Cavendish. But Dale believes it\u2019s not a magic bullet. The long-term answer, he thinks, is to bring greater diversity into the food system.\nDuring the research for my book Eating to Extinction, a conversation with Dale proved revelatory. Monocultures do not exist in nature, he told me, and we need to learn lessons from this. Much greater diversity used to exist in the global food system. But in introducing a smaller number of highly productive crops, this diversity was lost. In response to this, scientists at the UK\u2019s leading crop research centres, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) in Cambridge and the John Innes Centre in Norwich, are working to bring diversity back into the fields using genetics from heritage varieties that were pushed to the brink of extinction by modern varieties.\nScientists are looking at other precarious crops, such as coffee, which is made up of varieties that emerged from just a handful of plants sent around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries. The climate crisis is making the future of the coffee species we depend on \u2013 arabica and robusta \u2013 look bleak. This is why botanists at Kew have identified viable and delicious alternatives from the more than 120 other coffee species around the world. The most promising is Coffea stenophylla, a species found in Sierra Leone that almost went extinct in the 1950s.\nAt a policy level, there are reasons to be optimistic. At Cop15, held in December 2022 in Montreal, 196 countries signed up to the Global Biodiversity Framework. The headline pledge is to save 30% of nature on land and sea by 2030, part of which includes urgent action to \u201chalt extinction of threatened species\u201d. Less well known is the fact that these threatened species also include domesticated ones, referring to the 7,000 or so plants humans have used for food over millennia.\nAnd there are farmers\u2019 initiatives such as Wildfarmed, which is experimenting with a wider range of wheat varieties. The flour is already finding its way on to the high street through major retailers and nationwide pizza chains. Meanwhile, in the east of England, Hodmedod\u2019s, a business set up by three food and farming researchers, is looking back to what was grown in Britain during the iron age and reviving neglected varieties of grains and pulses, including carlin peas and emmer wheat.\nBut if Qu Dongyu is right that a big problem is the lack of \u201cacceptance by retailers and consumers of different varieties\u201d, we all need to step up. We need to let it be known that we want greater diversity. This rallying call could be as simple as buying a variety of bean or pea we haven\u2019t tried before, an unusual type of wheat, or even \u2013 if one were to appear in store \u2013 a different banana.\nDan Saladino is a food journalist, broadcaster and author of Eating to Extinction: The World\u2019s Rarest Foods and Why We Need to Save Them"},
{"headline": "Judges who belong to the Garrick have a choice: play fair by women, or stand down from rape and sexism cases ", "author": "Karon Monaghan", "teaser": "Judging requires an appearance of neutrality. But members of this elitist club are signalling their commitment to patriarchy", "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 15.12 CET", "content": "Nobody sensible believes that judges do not bring their prejudices to work but we, as lawyers, and no doubt the public, expect that judges will make an effort to keep them hidden.\nMost judges will have to decide a sex discrimination case or preside over a rape or sexual or domestic violence trial at one time or another in their career. When they do, they may well have to remind themselves and sometimes juries of the position of women in society, and counter gender stereotypes that might otherwise influence the outcome of the case. These stereotypes might be those that associate women with certain forms of work, caring for children or doing \u201cwomanly\u201d things (like not going out drinking in cosy clubs in the evening), or gender-related rape myths that blame women for men\u2019s sexual assaults upon them. Judges are supposed to do this \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d.\nBut the publication this week of the names of a number of judges who are members of the Garrick Club casts doubt on the inclination or ability of some of them to keep to this promise. The revelations come as no surprise to many lawyers and, indeed, other judges. Many past and present members of the judiciary are members of the Garrick, and the legal profession has always known this to be the case. From time to time, there are grumblings; some lawyers argue that judges should be prohibited from joining men-only clubs.\nLeaving aside gut feeling \u2013 the general queasiness at the image conjured up by the words \u201cprivate gentleman\u2019s club\u201d (whether Spearmint Rhino or the Garrick) \u2013 even lawyers sometimes struggle to pinpoint quite what is wrong with them. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to single-sex clubs. Women should be allowed to meet without the interruption of men. Lesbians should be able to have their own places in which to socialise and mobilise. Single-sex spaces are important, especially given that women often experience hostility or harassment in mixed-sex environments.\nBut the Garrick is not an ordinary club, and herein lies the problem. It is not a club where men with a shared heritage, or gay men, for example, meet for solidarity or for comfort. The Garrick is different. It is a place where powerful men hang out, forge relationships and work out who they can trust. Women lose out on the opportunity (should they wish to take it) of making those relationships and engendering trust among those they wish to have trust them. But more fundamentally, judges being members sends a message, including to female lawyers and judges, that powerful places are manly places.\nIt is not clear how you join the Garrick or, apart from being male, what the criteria are for membership. Its homepage tells the reader that its entry requirements are strict: \u201cIt would be better that 10 unobjectionable men should be excluded than one terrible bore should be admitted.\u201d This, we are told, means \u201cthe lively atmosphere for which the Club was so well-known in the 19th century continues to invigorate members of the Club in the 21st century\u201d.\nPerhaps the more than a third of members who obstructed the efforts of some who sought to have its constitution amended to admit women (a two-thirds majority being required) thought women who might have an interest in joining would not be sufficiently entertaining. Or perhaps they relied on prejudiced ideas about women\u2019s wittiness, competence, or trustworthiness. Or perhaps they simply did not want women, including female lawyers and judges, to enter a space reserved for the powerful. We cannot know. Nor do we know who voted to keep women out. Not that that would be any excuse. Serious dissatisfaction with a club\u2019s rules can easily be dealt with by relinquishing membership. We can take it that those who continue to be members do so content in the knowledge that their professional peers are excluded because of their sex.\nThis tells us a lot about those whose membership was exposed by the Guardian\u2019s Amelia Gentleman this week: from senior politicians to civil servants. But for judges there is an additional problem. Judging requires the appearance of neutrality. Membership of a club that functions to foster relationships between men at the centres of power, and that bars women from entry as members (though not presumably as cleaners and cooks), sends a message of partiality: a commitment to patriarchy.\nThe apparent determination by members of the judiciary to hang on to membership means that the criticism that is lobbed at them from time to time is not enough. Judges who are members of the Garrick should not be presiding over cases where sex or gender is a focal point in the case, as in discrimination cases and sexual and domestic violence cases. They cannot be trusted to be impartial or at the very least to be seen to be so.\nIf they cannot trust women to sit with them in the clubby corridors of power, we cannot trust them to do the right thing by women. Advocates must now seriously consider whether in some cases it might be appropriate to ask a judge whether he is a member of the Garrick and, if so, to ask that he recuse himself so that justice can be seen to be done.\nKaron Monaghan KC is a barrister specialising in equality and human rights law"},
{"headline": "The collapse of Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks is a death knell for industrial, working-class Britain", "author": "Keith Gildart", "teaser": "UK industrial towns offered not only well-paid jobs, but a whole culture. A radical alternative is desperately needed", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 14.37 CET", "content": "Last week, Tata Steel in Port Talbot announced the immediate closure of its coke ovens. These ovens create the coke that ultimately powers the blast furnaces, which, as was announced in January, are due to be shut down. The decision by Tata to close the furnaces sent shock waves through the community. There are set to be 2,800 job losses \u2013 a huge blow for a small town that has already undergone significant cuts to its steel industry over the past decades. A final chapter in the decades-long deindustrialisation of the British economy appears to be coming to a close.\nPlant closures are never only about the loss of work, but also the cultural and psychological effects on the people who are made unemployed, on families and communities. Steel provided well-paid, unionised and skilled employment, and created a working-class culture that gave the country Labour MPs, athletes, musicians, writers, artists and a sense of community and collective purpose. Port Talbot even gave the world the cinematic presence of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins.\nSuch a distinct, collectivist culture was crucial to the development of Wales, central Scotland and parts of England in the 19th and 20th centuries. At its peak in the 1960s, Port Talbot steelworks employed about 18,000 workers, complemented by the nearly 60,000 employed in south Wales coalmines. These industries after the second world war offered an alternative vision of industrial relations, investment, community development, and a Wales (and Britain) with working-class agency at its centre.\nThe seeds of the destruction of this world of labour were planted with the mass closures of coalmines in the late 1950s and then the 1960s, with patchy attempts by governments to mitigate the effects. But the election of a Labour government in 1974 granted a temporary reprieve to the steel and coal industries. The subsequent Plan for Coal envisaged a long-term future for the industry with the introduction of new technology, skills and high wages. In these years, a miner could become an engineer, a mine manager, an official of the National Coal Board, a trade union official or a Labour MP. Others could take advantage of the education provided by the National Union of Mineworkers and enter university. Having started work as a coalminer in 1985, I took this path in 1992, studying history and politics and eventually became a university professor. Yet with the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, a darkness descended over the steel and coal communities.\nThe warning shot for British Steel and Welsh industry came with the closure of Shotton in March 1980, when 6,500 jobs were axed in a single day. The steel strike of the same year ended in defeat for the steelworkers. By the time Ian MacGregor left his role at British Steel in 1983 to move on to the National Coal Board, he had cut the steel workforce by almost 60% in only three years. After the crushing defeat of the miners in their year-long fight against closures in 1984-85, pits rapidly disappeared from the British landscape. The destruction of communities quickly followed. Both the moderate leadership of the steel unions and the more militant activism of the miners could do nothing to stem the tide of unemployment, inequality, poverty and the transformation of the world of work.\nWhat has the loss of this world ushered in? The impact can be seen not just in Port Talbot but across the post-industrial regions of Wales, England and Scotland. While that industrial world of work brought with it risks to life and health, the income, opportunities and relative security offered stability. That has been replaced by warehousing, logistics, retail parks that offer zero-hours contracts, low wages, no long-term security and hostility to trade union membership and representation. Decades after the closures, Britain\u2019s coalfields are still feeling the long-term effects, suffering disproportionately from multiple inequalities.\nThe deindustrialisation of Britain and the marginalisation of the working class has also had a profound impact on political engagement and representation. Your Labour MP is now likely to be a lawyer, special adviser and expensively educated graduate, rather than a steelworker or a coalminer. Meanwhile, the organised working class has moved further to the periphery of political and civic British life. At the same time, perhaps counterintuitively, the old industrial workforce is viewed with a sense of deference rather than suspicion. Steelworkers and coalminers have gone from being labelled as industrial dinosaurs, technological Luddites and enemies within, to being almost canonised through films such as The Full Monty and Billy Elliot.\nThat is all very well and good, but what is really needed is an appreciation of the communities and the political alternatives that they provided. Post-steel and post-coal localities need a radical industrial policy that would bring high-paid jobs, skills and opportunities that could form the basis of a real driver of levelling up. As the Port Talbot coke ovens close, what is the government doing to fill the void?\nKeith Gildart is a former coalminer, and now a professor of labour and social history at the University of Wolverhampton"},
{"headline": "Synthetic opioids have arrived in Britain. As a former drug dealer, I know how the UK should respond", "author": "Niko Vorobyov", "teaser": "There are better ways of tackling addiction and overdoses than reverting to the tactics of a failed drugs war", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 16.24 CET", "content": "Last week the home secretary, James Cleverly, announced that nitazenes are now being treated as class A drugs, his statement bookended with the usual stern rhetoric about the need to keep \u201cthese vile drugs off our streets\u201d. The maximum penalty for selling or supplying class As is life imprisonment.\nCleverly\u2019s decision follows the discovery that several victims of deadly drug poisonings had nitazenes in their system. Nitazenes are synthetic opioids, meaning they are similar to the heroin and morphine refined from opium poppies but made entirely in a lab. First developed as painkillers in the 1950s but never approved for medical use, they have been found mixed into heroin to give the low-grade variety of the drug that extra kick, as well as in bootleg Xanax and Valium pills sold on the dark web. Up to 500 times stronger than morphine, even a tiny amount can prove fatal.\nIn these relatively few instances, there are echoes of the US\u2019s overdose epidemic, which now claimsmore than 100,000 lives a year \u2013 more than half of which are from fentanyl, another synthetic opioid. This outbreak has sparked a revival of tough-on-drugs policies. But if the UK risks sliding towards an opioid crisis, these are the pitfalls we must avoid.\nA month ago, the state of Oregon repealed its Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act (known as Measure 110), which had passed by referendum in 2020, decriminalising personal quantities of narcotics as part of a \u201chealth-based\u201d based approach to drug addiction. Under that law, users weren\u2019t arrested for holding a gram of cocaine, but instead were fined $100 unless they entered into drug treatment services. Dealing, meanwhile, was still classified as a crime. But amid a spiralling death toll from the fentanyl crisis, and homeless people\u2019s tents filling the sidewalks, lawmakers panicked and reversed their decision. Drug users caught with small quantities of drugs may now face prison again.\nThis reversion to the drug-war norm makes little sense \u2013 it has been proved time and time again that greater criminalisation does nothing to lower addiction rates. Politicians lost their nerve in Oregon because of a rise in drug fatalities after Measure 110 was passed \u2013 but as one study showed, this is more to do with the growing prevalence of fentanyl than users taking greater risks because of looser penalties. It is a fact that wherever fentanyl hits the market in the US, the death rate shoots up. Police action disrupting the supply chain only makes matters worse, as new dealers appear with unknown strength and quality. A recent study in Indiana found that fatal overdoses spiked each time there was a major drug bust.\nA growing street homelessness problem \u2013 and the very public drug-taking that many of those on the streets are embroiled in \u2013 also forced the hand of lawmakers. But people don\u2019t pitch up a tent under a bypass because of addiction issues. West Virginia has been among the worst-hit by drug deaths, but boasts the lowest homelessness rate. Why? Housing there is relatively cheap, while average rents in Oregon doubled between 2020 and 2021. Could it be that unaffordable rents are pushing people from their homes? No, it must be the drugs!\nSnapping on the handcuffs doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve tried tramadol, drunk lean (a cocktail of codeine plus soda) and smoked opium, and I get why folks grow addicted to opioids. If your life feels empty and hopeless, why not? They don\u2019t fill the void, but they let you not care. They\u2019re like an anaesthetic for inner pain. One recent study found that 96% of patients leaving mandatory detox relapsed within months, proving that caging people does not cure them of their trauma. You simply can\u2019t force someone into sobriety.\nWhat could Britain do differently? In the 1980s, a Liverpool clinic headed by Welsh doctor John Marks provided free heroin and cocaine courtesy of the NHS. There was no toxic fentanyl or nitazenes, no one dropped dead from an overdose, and the stability of a steady fix gave their patients a chance to live normal lives, holding down jobs and rebuilding bonds with their families without being on edge for policemen or pushers. Their business drying up, heroin dealers began disappearing from the area.\nSo why should law-abiding taxpayers foot the bill for these junkies getting their jollies? Well for a start, it\u2019s more cost-efficient. The cohort of patients at a similar clinic in Middlesborough committed 541 crimes prior to entering the programme, costing \u00a32.1m in taxpayer money. And if they were locked away in prison, it cost another \u00a347,000 a year to keep them housed and fed, again at taxpayers\u2019 expense. Giving them free heroin, on the other hand, costs only \u00a312,000 per year, while giving them a chance to get their life back together. Over a period of six months, the Middlesborough cohort committed a grand total of three crimes, all had found a roof over their heads (many were previously unhoused), and they had stopped buying smack from their dealers (which may have contained toxic additives) almost entirely. That is, until funding was cut in 2022.\nFeeding their dependency wasn\u2019t an ideal solution, but since long-term diamorphine use \u2013 ie clinically pure heroin \u2013 causes minimal damage to the body, certainly less than alcohol, it avoids the absolute worst consequences. You can\u2019t help someone if they\u2019re dead.\nWith the Taliban\u2019s poppy ban cutting off the heroin supply from Afghanistan, it\u2019s likely that synthetic opioids will become more common on Britain\u2019s illicit narcotics scene, regardless of whether they\u2019re class A, B or Z. To get ahead of the game, safe supply is the only logical solution.\n Niko Vorobyov is a Russian-British freelance journalist, convicted drug peddler and author of Dopeworld"},
{"headline": "Living with my mum has been a blessing \u2013 but young adults should not be forced back into the family home", "author": "Jason Okundaye", "teaser": "Although there are significant financial and emotional benefits to returning to the nest, it should be a choice", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 13.14 CET", "content": "The 2021 census already confirmed it: more adult children than ever are still living with their parents. But the Financial Times has recently revealed just how drastically the scales have tipped: about 40% of 18- to 34-year-olds now live with their parents, making it the most common domestic arrangement for this age group. Previously, it was living as a couple with children.\nIt\u2019s not just an epidemic of Young, Dumb and Living Off Mum \u2013 I\u2019ve moved back home twice since graduating in 2018, and I know plenty of young well-to-do professionals who have felt obliged to do the same, or not moved out at all. There are also plenty of people who are unable to live in their family home due to distance and perhaps wish they could.\nAnd even though it\u2019s framed in terms of the housing crisis, so long as you\u2019re not trapped in an abusive household, being able to live at home is an immense privilege \u2013 it helps you to save and means you have more money for recreation. But beyond the column inches on the state of the housing market, there is also the question of what this situation means for the state of family relationships, and if it damages them or is a welcome reprieve from \u201cempty nest syndrome\u201d.\nParents are typically happy to alleviate their children\u2019s housing costs if it will help them to set up their future, particularly in an economic climate so different from the time when they themselves were finding homes and building families. And sometimes parents are all the better for keeping their children home. Of course there will be tensions and frustrations, as there are whenever adults spend extended periods of time together, but with the loneliness and emotional distress of empty nest syndrome often cited as a cause of marital breakdown, there is some light to be found in staying at home longer.\nAlso, if your parents are single or widowed, like my mother, it can introduce the possibility of maintaining an adult relationship in the home that they have been missing. Certainly, while I have radical views on the housing market and resent that I\u2019m forced to live at home due to the cost of everything, it has brought my mother and I closer in a way that may not have been possible if I had been living away from home for an unbroken period during the past six years.\nPeople often speak of a sadness they experience watching their parents age, but there is something to be said about being able to adjust to it by witnessing it more gradually, rather than being taken aback by their advancing age at each periodic visit.\nBut the feasibility of staying home often relies on how well you\u2019re able to get along with your parents (and other adult siblings) and whether or not you\u2019ll rub each other up the wrong way. For some young adults \u2013 particularly those who have spent three or more years living independently at university \u2013 it can feel like a regression into childhood dynamics \u2013 nagging about dishes, the blue or pink paint of your childhood bedroom, having to confirm what time you\u2019ll be home and feeling guilty if your parents have waited up for you after a night partying.\nThen there are the privacy issues. Everyone has heard an icky horror story of a parent coming into their child\u2019s bedroom and discovering lingerie or a sex toy. And if your parents aren\u2019t as liberal as Regina George\u2019s in Mean Girls, you might end up either forking out a fortune on hotels just to be able to have sex with a partner who also lives at home, or restricting liaisons to when your parents are away.\nOne flip side to remaining with your parents is the rush to partner-up and move in together so you can split bills while recovering some privacy, or finding yourself more attracted to a person you would typically overlook purely because they can accommodate you. The romantic consequences of which are picking a partner for the wrong reasons and splitting up quickly, or the relationship being undone by the early pressure of cohabitation, ultimately leading you back to your blue-walled bedroom again.\nRegardless of the financial and emotional benefits, or the drawbacks, of living at home, that this has become the default arrangement for young people is troubling and consequential. Last year I was dismayed to read about two adult children being removed from their family\u2019s social housing after their mother died suddenly from an aneurysm. Particularly if you only live with one parent, it can only take one incident for your security blanket to be snatched away \u2013 so you end up hyperconscious of the health of your parent.\nIt might be nice to spend more time with your parents as they age, and to have more cash for a holiday or nice things, but some unintended positive side-effects do not detract from the simple fact that cheaper secure housing remains a core demand for young people.\nJason Okundaye is a London-based writer and author of Revolutionary Acts: Black Gay Men in Britain"},

Echoing the campaigners, Mordaunt claims that the West Africa Squadron, which was active until the 1860s, was \u201cthe main actor in physically destroying the slave trade\u201d, but this is a dramatic overstatement: though the squadron is credited with capturing 1,600 ships and freeing 150,000 enslaved Africans, more than 3 million people were trafficked across the Atlantic while it was active.\nAccording to the campaign, the statue will depict three key parts of the story of the West Africa Squadron: \u201cthe evil of slavery, the bravery of the sailors and the new life for the freed Africans\u201d.\nBritain banned the slave trade in 1807, after almost 20 years of parliamentary debate on the matter. It took another quarter-century for Britain to abolish slavery across the empire, and another five years after that for the full emancipation of the enslaved.\nThe West Africa Squadron was deployed from 1808 with the task of stopping British slave-trading ships, but this initial enforcement took on a more humanitarian bent as the squadron began to target the ships of other countries as well. The campaign for a monument is correct that significant resources were committed to this mission: over a period of 60 years, the Royal Navy spent millions of pounds on the squadron, and 1,600 sailors lost their lives. But even this was hugely insufficient: the ships were old, slow and too few in number, and the unit is estimated to have intercepted fewer than 10% of the ships involved in the slave trade.\nMore significantly, \u201cthe new life for the freed Africans\u201d rescued by the squadron was hardly free. The estimated 150,000 men, women and children whose ships were captured suffered continued exploitation and degradation at the hands of the British.\nAfter intercepting slave ships bound for the Americas, the West Africa Squadron sailed the formerly enslaved human cargo to British colonies; namely, Sierra Leone and Saint Helena. Once docked, captured Africans were made to remain onboard ships for long periods (sometimes months) in squalid conditions while lengthy British bureaucracy ensued: this led to high rates of unnecessary deaths and disease.\nOnce allowed off the ships, the \u201cliberated Africans\u201d \u2013 as they were known at the time \u2013 were not repatriated to their home countries; they were instead subject to forced hard labour under poor conditions, reminiscent of the slavery they narrowly escaped. Military conscription was the fate of \u201cliberated\u201d men; \u201cliberated\u201d children were subject to apprenticeship, where they worked for a master with no wage for a number of years. In Sierra Leone, there are reports of unmarried \u201cliberated\u201d women being forced into marriage.\nThe legitimate effort to remember the history of the West Africa Squadron should not require the repetition of falsehoods, like the myth of the \u201cliberated Africans\u201d or the misconception that the Royal Navy \u201cended slavery\u201d.\nEmancipation was not simply given to the enslaved by benevolent sailors. It was fought for. This history deserves commemoration just as much as the advocacy of William Wilberforce and the work of the squadron. Britain\u2019s decision to finally abolish slavery in 1833 was itself influenced by the 1831-32 slave revolt in Jamaica, also known as the Christmas rebellion, which helped shock parliament into acting.\nOne year ago, in a powerful essay for the Guardian\u2019s Cotton Capital project, Gary Younge addressed our nation\u2019s ability to \u201cforget\u201d the gritty realities of our slaving past. Far from an innocent moment of amnesia, this \u201cforgetting\u201d is a destructive task, and a \u201cprivilege of the powerful\u201d.\nWhat we choose to remember of Britain\u2019s legacy of slavery does not seem to require adherence to historical fact, but refers instead to some axiomatic, felt understanding about who we are as a nation. And so the pursuit of historical truth becomes an \u201canti-British\u201d blasphemy, seen as an attempt to vandalise the myth that Britain\u2019s only relationship to slavery was to abolish it.\nAcknowledging the complicated history of the West Africa Squadron is not an unpatriotic lament; it is part of establishing a healthier relationship with the complexities of our past, based on a sturdier and more honest foundation. Britain\u2019s history of abolition can still be a proud one \u2013 as long as it is not built on mistruths.\nElla Sinclair is a freelance writer who covers race, history, politics and social justice\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is out of date and wrong", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "teaser": "I feel strongly that any association of citizens in a free society should be allowed to make its own rules. But this ban is absurd", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 13.09 CET", "content": "Do clubs matter? Yes, to their members, and clearly to those they exclude. When Alexis de Tocqueville compared American democracy with British, he said America\u2019s roots were in the mob and Britain\u2019s in the club. Americans vote for a president who doesn\u2019t sit in Congress. Britons vote for a member of parliament, a tight-knit Westminster club.\nThe revived argument over London\u2019s Garrick Club would have been music to De Tocqueville\u2019s ears. Here we go again, a gang of London elitists ruling the land from a Covent Garden palace untainted by plebs or women. And this in the 21st century. Give us a break.\nPlaces where those of like mind can meet and enjoy each other\u2019s company are valuable. They enrich leisure and guard against loneliness. As guilds, lodges and associations, they exist in every community \u2013 including some for men and women separately. London\u2019s clubs are a case in point. The Garrick, where I am a member, is not some fiendish hotbed of influence. Its average age is about 70 and those who frequent it are overwhelmingly retired. In my view, it cannot be regarded as a significant centre of power, but rather a good place to eat and entertain. It is popular and certainly livelier than traditional clubland haunts.\nThe Garrick was named after the actor David Garrick, as the club for London\u2019s theatrical and arts community. Its \u201caffinity\u201d was no different from the military clubs\u2019 exclusion of certain classes of soldier or the university clubs\u2019 restriction to Oxbridge. All originally excluded women. Many clubs such as Brooks\u2019s, Boodle\u2019s, the Travellers and the Savile continue this exclusion of women, or exclusion of men in the case of the University Women\u2019s. The Savile kept its cool in 2017 when it allowed a member to stay after they transitioned to become a woman. Margaret Thatcher was made a member of the men-only Carlton Club in 1975, largely because no one dared exclude her.\nWhat makes the Garrick different \u2013 and has attracted media attention \u2013 is that some of its members are prominent in public affairs, including, apparently, the king. He is not known to have used the club. Membership seems to confer networking power beyond its walls. In particular, the Garrick has long been favoured by senior lawyers, with a profusion of senior judges. The judiciary is a largely self-governing profession and many lawyers \u2013 not only women \u2013 have come to regard membership as divisive and potentially a kind of freemasonry. Earlier this week a number of judges were pressed into resigning. It is within the legal world these concerns are concentrated. I really do not think such a charge could be directed at other professions at the club. It is merely absurd, not career-damaging, that Stephen Fry can belong to the Garrick, but not Judi Dench.\nIn truth, the Garrick\u2019s problem over women attracts publicity because, unlike the other all-male clubs, it contains a large number of progressive members who want women in and who have been fighting for it for years. In the last two votes on women, in 2015 and last autumn, a clear majority was in favour, but the rules stated that two-thirds was required to carry. Legal opinion has since been sought, and it is plain that there is no actual rule opposing female members. There is therefore no rule that has to be changed. The membership committee can simply allow women to join.\nI feel strongly that any association of citizens in a free society should be allowed to hold its own opinions and make its own rules, from political parties to London clubs. But for me, the exclusion of women from havens of civilised conversation and debate is the opposite of liberal. It is out of date and wrong.\nIn the case of the Garrick, this is not a purely private matter. The club has become a symbolic institution on London\u2019s cultural scene, its exclusivity a practice that should long ago have ended. The majority of its members clearly want that discrimination to end. I sense it is about to happen. I look forward to celebrating it.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "\u2018Neighbourhood restaurants\u2019 \u2013 really? These Instagrammable impostors are nothing of the sort", "author": "Lauren O'Neill", "teaser": "The term evokes cosiness, affordability and community. But it\u2019s being used as a cynical marketing ploy", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 10.00 CET", "content": "What makes a neighbourhood restaurant? The phrase itself is evocative, bringing to mind the types of local trattorias or ocakba\u015flar\u0131 or tavernas that punters return to regularly. The definition might vary from person to person, but surely a neighbourhood restaurant is defined by some combination of its longevity in the community, an accessible feel and affordable prices.\nOver the past six months, though, I have seen the \u201cneighbourhood restaurant\u201d label deployed constantly in PR emails previewing a very different sort of establishment. The aim, I imagine, is to evoke a sense of cosiness and community \u2013 but there\u2019s something off about it.\nThese self-proclaimed neighbourhood restaurants usually feel something like this: the walls are white, wines are \u201clow-intervention\u201d (meaning natural), and the branding is jaunty and Instagram-scroll friendly. \u201cSeasonal ingredients\u201d and \u201cmodern European\u201d dishes abound. You might expect a neighbourhood restaurant by definition to respond to the specific needs of its neighbourhood, but a lot of these places actually tend to be pretty identikit, informed above all else by a more ambient, social media-aware aesthetic.\nThese clean, neat spaces recall the journalist Kyle Chayka\u2019s concept of AirSpace, or, as he puts it, \u201cthe strangely frictionless geography created by digital platforms, in which you could move between places without \u2026 leaving the bubble of the generic aesthetic\u201d.\nIn London, these so-called neighbourhood spots spring up in areas like Islington or Hackney, or any other place with a high concentration of upwardly mobile digital natives. These are consumers who snap photos of expensive pastries and hunt down dishes hyped up online, for whom food is yet another aspect of a curated, postable lifestyle.\nAs someone who has, in her time, queued 45 minutes for a falafel sandwich seen online, I am admittedly part of the crowd whose tastes these places are designed to appeal to. I don\u2019t mind saying that some of what I enjoy is governed by what I see on my phone: I like pretty plates of crudo and thick slices of terrine that look lovely in a photo. Nor do I begrudge a savvy restaurant using the world\u2019s biggest marketing platforms to its advantage (unless the food is rubbish). At the same time, neighbourhood restaurant rankles as a marketing term because it feels like it is often used by the kind of restaurants that often don\u2019t have an awful lot to do with their local communities.\nThere is a likely reason behind the recent use of the term. Within food media there is a growing, but long overdue, appreciation of the food of migrant and working-class communities, hitherto overlooked by some in the mainstream. As a result of this emphasis on diversity, readers and diners have a sharper understanding of the roles restaurants play in their communities.\nAs far as I can see, then, \u201cneighbourhood restaurant\u201d can be deployed pretty cynically, to detract from the accusations of gentrification that are now frequently \u2013 and usually correctly \u2013 levelled at flashy new restaurant openings in areas where wealth disparities are high, and longstanding local communities continue to be priced out. But you can\u2019t simply declare yourself a neighbourhood restaurant in a press release or social media bio and make it so. It is surely a status that is earned.\nActual neighbourhood restaurants \u2013 examples quickly plucked from my own recent dining experiences include east London\u2019s brilliant Al Kahf, the jovial Bar D4100 in Nunhead, south-east London, or Kababish in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley \u2013 rarely claim to be as such. They just are, because they\u2019re placed to appeal to a wide range of punters and to serve them with a mix of affordability, local knowledge, quality and a welcoming atmosphere.\nLots of these restaurants integrate seamlessly because they\u2019ve been started by local people \u2013 for instance, Dinner for One Hundred, the family business behind Bar D4100, started life in the founders\u2019 mum\u2019s garden during lockdown \u2013 or because they\u2019ve made an effort to be a genuine part of the community, like east London\u2019s Dusty Knuckle bakeries, whose youth programmes give jobs to young people in those areas looking for a new start.\nA high-profile example of the way in which some \u201cneighbourhood restaurants\u201d are said to fall short of this standard is Straker\u2019s, the chef Thomas Straker\u2019s eponymous restaurant, which opened on Notting Hill\u2019s Golborne Road in 2022. The restaurant is described on its own website as \u201cserving a neighbourhood vibe\u201d (a main will set you back about \u00a330); but in July 2023, when Straker posted a photo of the restaurant\u2019s on-shift kitchen staff, they were all white and male. Considering the venue in west London is on a street known for its Portuguese and Moroccan immigrant communities, the image was called out as tone-deaf. Critics asked why there had not been more of an effort to compile a staff team that was representative of the area.\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard, Straker said that while his business \u201ccan always be better\u201d, he found some social media users\u2019 insinuation that he and his chefs all looked the same \u201cincredibly offensive to the point where \u2026 actually they should apologise\u201d. In the same interview, the restaurateur said he had changed his hiring practices since the photo was taken.\nStraker\u2019s isn\u2019t the only restaurant accused of just plonking itself down without considering the context. The growing practice is a symptom of our increasingly siloed cities, as gentrification rages on, and community spaces continue to close due to a lack of funding. There are, then, some labels that require responsibility: if you want the kudos of calling yourself a neighbourhood restaurant, the least you can do is actually act like one.\nLauren O\u2019Neill is a culture writer"},

Come to Poland: see how they can be pushed back ", "author": "Anne McElvoy", "teaser": "Donald Tusk is working hard and fast on a great transformation, but travel the country and it\u2019s clear what a difficult task that is", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 08.00 CET", "content": "My formative journalistic years were spent reporting on the final freeze of the cold war \u2013 days of hard times and soft currencies. When I return to those countries now, I test myself on how well I guessed what would follow in the three decades since. On Poland in particular, I would have been hard pressed to predict the giddy zigzag of power still featuring a generation who marched to topple communism, but whose protagonists feud bitterly about how to govern the country in the 21st century.\nWe talk a lot about places that have recently bought a one-way ticket towards authoritarian politics \u2013 Russia and Turkey for the full-fat versions, and Hungary\u2019s democratic backsliding and stifling of independent institutions.\nI had pondered about what happens when a country that embraced populist nationalism does a 180-degree turn and seeks to restore legal and democratic norms at top speed. What happens to laws passed under the previous masters of the house: the courts, state media, and business and other institutions stuffed by supporters of one side?\nPoland, in the wake of an election last year that ended eight years of rule by the rightwing Law and Justice party in favour of a coalition headed by Donald Tusk\u2019s Civil Platform, is in the eye of all these legal, ethical and practical storms. A documentary for BBC Radio 4 gave me the chance to chart this volte-face as the Tusk government takes an \u201ciron broom\u201d to sweep away a legacy of ultra-conservative rule.\nBut there\u2019s also the story that is more nuanced and paradoxical here: the new government won an election, and forged an alliance in power that represents a lot of the country \u2013 but by no means all of it. As it sweeps away obstacles to its will, it will need to restore pluralism to avoid repeating aspects of the absolutism it replaces.\nFor a government led by Tusk, a bullish pro-European veteran of centrist politics who is not of the charm school persuasion (Brexiters were on the receiving end of his mordant style when he wished the Johnsonian variety a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d), and with little common ground yet visible, that might well be the difference between a durable return to the centre of politics and yet another hairpin change of direction.\nBut as my producer and I travelled from the buzzy streets of Warsaw, via the Law and Justice stronghold of Wadowice \u2013 where a lady coming out of the basilica responded tartly to the question about Tusk\u2019s government by saying it was \u201ctime he came back to God\u201d \u2013 to Krak\u00f3w, to speak to one woman caught up in the implementation of draconian abortion laws, it felt like veering giddily from one world to another. People claimed that they understood the destiny of their country while turning a deaf ear to others\u2019 views.\nIt is not hard for western European liberals to identify with a figure like the deputy justice minister, Dariusz Mazur, who describes himself as \u201cvery tired\u201d after years of tussle over control of courts, regulators and legal certification bodies. For him, it\u2019s about cleaning out a judicial system stacked by Law and Justice \u2013 while avoiding the obvious pitfall of this government being seen as replacing one lot of favourites with another.\nThere\u2019s also a fraught dealing here with the idea of Europe. The Tusk government is EU friendly: he is a veteran of Brussels and adept at working it to appeal to Poland\u2019s desire to be taken more seriously. A return to the European \u201cfamily\u201d and access to EU-derived funds was part of the appeal. The \u201ciron broom\u201d, however, might have met a hard stop as the European Central Bank raises objections to the Tusk government\u2019s threat of a tribunal aimed to oust Poland\u2019s central bank boss, on the grounds that it infringes the bank\u2019s independence.\nThese attempts to eradicate eight years of a rightward \u201cstate capture\u201d, with personal cronyism as well as ideology, guarantee a lengthy period of institutional muddle \u2013 it\u2019s not even clear whether the president, Andrzej Duda (loyal to the old team), will allow the prime minister to swap out ambassadors he wants recalled.\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nTusk has been (by his uncompromising standards) conciliatory in insisting that this is a recalibration \u201cnot a retaliation\u201d, though it\u2019s hard to see that landing well with a large chunk of voters whose rightwing party won the largest share of the vote at the election. And the new government is held together by a coalition that itself contains many shades of opinion, infuriating the many young activists and voters who helped drive change by turning out en masse to oust Law and Justice \u2013 and now hanker for faster results on abortion and other social reforms.\nEconomically, a thriving Poland defies my expectations as the country I remember from the doldrums of the late 1980s, when a stint in the Dickensian conditions of Warsaw\u2019s Rosa Luxemburg lightbulb factory would have been enough to put anyone off thinking that communism was an illuminating idea.\nNow, it\u2019s approached the EU average on household wealth, ahead of Spain and nudging Ireland, and the main cities feel like cosmopolitan havens, with a new sprinkling of Ukrainians who have fled west to start new lives \u2013 my friend\u2019s dog-clipper is from Kharkiv, my manicurist fled from Odesa.\nThe new Poland still bears the echoes of grim events. But it might well turn out to be a test case for other states or movements in Europe and beyond that one day want to turn back from the \u201cultra\u201d model. The moral of this story is that it\u2019s necessary \u2013 but not easy.\nAnne McElvoy is executive editor of Politico.

I have a plan to raise billions to address that ", "author": "Gordon Brown", "teaser": "With will and ingenuity, communities, charities, companies and government could work together to rescue millions of people", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.46 CET", "content": "An election year is the time to confront the paralysing gloom and declinist thinking besetting our country and, by rediscovering our moral compass, inaugurate a new age of hope.\nThe British people long to feel part of a shared national endeavour. But instead, near-zero growth is giving birth to a zero-sum mentality, a belief that you can only do better if at someone else\u2019s expense. Young people \u2013 historically the most optimistic about the future \u2013 yearn to believe in something bigger than themselves, yet this generation is fast losing faith in the very idea of progress. But the most devastating twist in this doom loop is the one created by rising poverty, the despair and divisions it causes, and the mounting public concern about its impact on our social cohesion. To break out of this downward spiral, Britain needs a reason for optimism \u2013 and a good starting point is a new partnership to end destitution and poverty that, by bringing charities, companies, communities and government together in a common national project, shows the United Kingdom can be united in more than just name.\nFor these are desperate times for today\u2019s poor children. That 4.3 million children \u2013 a number equivalent to four cities the size of Birmingham \u2013 were last week declared to be below the official poverty line is shameful enough, but on the ground we are now witnessing types of penury we once imagined we had consigned to history. Children now form 1.5 million of the 6 million people enduring \u2018very deep\u2019 poverty, living not only below the standard breadline, drawn at 60% of the typical income, but below 40%. One million children are thought to have had a recent brush with \u2018destitution\u2019, defined as being without the absolute basics: keeping warm, dry, clean, housed and fed.\nLast night, 140,000 children were homeless, and 1.1 million youngsters tried to go to sleep without a bed of their own; it is estimated that 2.6 million children are missing out on meals. No society can or should be at ease when children are being brought up in houses without heating, kitchens without cookers, bedrooms without beds, floors without floor covering, or toilets without toilet roll or soap. And all the evidence is that, unless we act, things will get even worse.\nBut how to fix it? Three seismic shifts have unfolded over the last decade. First, the welfare safety net has been systematically shredded, with the government abandoning responsibilities taken for granted since 1945. Second, charities and food banks, which have taken over from universal credit as the last line of defence, are exhausted and justifiably angry about having to pick up the pieces with insufficient resources. They even fear their desperate relief efforts could provide cover for the government walking further away. Third, unsure how they fit into a poverty-free, pollution-free future, the corporate sector has in the last decade donated less, not more. Yet the many business leaders who are now championing a greater sense of environmental and social responsibility know they can, and should, play a bigger role.\nWith Jeremy Hunt now hinting at an autumn mini-budget, this government has a last chance to break with the past decade and offer hope to millions by setting out a firm timetable for abolishing destitution and ending extreme poverty.\nThere can be no ducking the changing nature of the poverty we are addressing. A generation ago, worklessness was the overwhelming cause. Today, nearly three poor children in four live in a working household and no government can perpetuate the myth any more that the majority of our poor people are workshy or part of a dependency culture. Alongside a root-and-branch review of universal credit to reflect this, we should be raising the pay floor, creating new opportunities to climb the career ladder including through better skills (today only one in six on low pay ever escape low pay), and rewiring the various markets \u2013 for utilities, travel, rented housing and childcare \u2013 that are currently skewed against poorer families. We should offer NHS help to those who are sick and economically inactive to restore their fitness before delivering any lectures on laziness.\nBut action cannot await reviews and phased reforms, however necessary. Were the government to declare the end of poverty to be a national goal and set clear deadlines, there would be a way out of the current emergency. Then it could credibly invite charities, corporations and community and civil society groups to join a time-limited partnership to alleviate poverty now. Only then will it be understood that the shared goal is not to for ever fall back on food banks in place of the necessary long-term solutions, but to create immediate breathing space as government transitions us away from mass poverty.\nWithin the bounds of the fiscal envelope, government can build on the \u00a31bn a year that has until now been allocated to the household support fund. A start could be made with between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a33.3bn found by imposing a similar reserve requirement on banks that the European Central Bank, the Swiss and others currently do (and we once did), thus hypothecating for poverty eradication a small fraction of what banks currently receive in interest payments on their balances at the Bank of England.\nBy simplifying the Gift Aid system, \u00a3700m of ancillary relief, which currently can end up being back with higher-earning donors, can go straight to good causes. And the Chancellor\u2019s autumn statement could also offer additional time-limited tax incentives to encourage more giving. The top 1% donate overall just 0.2% of their income \u2013 that\u2019s just \u00a3538 a year from average incomes of \u00a3271,000. But if that top 1% were incentivised to donate just 1%, \u00a31.4 billion a year could be raised for good causes.\nSome companies take corporate philanthropy seriously, but overall their donations represent just 0.8% of the pretax profits of FTSE 100 companies. But even if the real value of their donations had remained at its level of ten years ago, good causes would now be at least \u00a35bn better off.\nFor the period of this current emergency, companies should consider donating more of their surplus products \u2013 and so reduce pollution as well as poverty. But if they cannot give free of charge, they should offer to sell to charities essential goods \u2013 toothpaste, nappies, toilet rolls, soap and shampoo, as well as food \u2013 at production cost or less.\nIf we share the discounted cost, and if families are referred through social workers, teachers, health visitors and GPs as well as food banks, we would be getting vital goods to those too impoverished to buy, and doing so in the most cost-effective way. Indeed, in the pilot phase of the new Multibanks \u2013 which sit alongside food banks and are food, clothes, bedding, toiletries, furnishings, and baby banks rolled into one \u2013 every \u00a31 donated has procured supplies worth \u00a35 in value.\nThis partnership is not a permanent or comprehensive solution. It would be a one- or two-year transitional arrangement, which would only succeed if the government offers benefit improvements that exceed the value of what others provide in kind. It would not be the end of poverty, but it is the signal the whole country needs: the beginning of the end. It would address the costs crippling families now, and create the headroom in which to fix our welfare safety net. With communities, charities, companies and government working together to deliver a shared national goal, we can rapidly banish destitution, and support the 2,600 food banks in their ambition to make themselves redundant \u2013 and a divided country can find unity, and hope, again.\nGordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"},

So where\u2019s her plan to achieve it?", "author": "Larry Elliott", "teaser": "Promising to reform the planning system, boost investment and improve skills is all very well, but the detail is missing", "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 18.37 CET", "content": "The pursuit of growth is an obsession for politicians the world over. Olaf Scholz thinks more growth would make him a more popular German chancellor. Xi Jinping sets growth targets in China and they are invariably met. Here in Britain, Rachel Reeves mentioned the word 58 times when she delivered the prestigious Mais lecture this week.\nThe almost fetishistic worship of gross domestic product as a measure of how well a country is doing is curious, because even the statisticians responsible for producing economic data accept it is an incomplete performance measure. GDP rises as a result of cleaning up after oil spills, but takes no account of the benefits of unpaid work. As a yardstick, it is clearly flawed.\nA classic example of GDP\u2019s limitations came just this week with the release of the 2024 World Happiness report. This showed that the US had dropped out of the top 20 list of happiest nations despite being comfortably the fastest growing of the G7 developed economies in recent years.\nThe study suggests much more attention should be paid to rising levels of misery among Americans aged 15 to 24 and rather less to whether the quarterly GDP figures show growth accelerating or not. Sadly, that almost certainly won\u2019t happen because higher levels of growth are axiomatically considered to be a good thing while any fall in GDP is viewed as a disaster. In the grand scheme of things, it didn\u2019t matter much that Britain had slipped into technical recession after two successive quarters of negative growth in the second half of last year, but it was still seen as a big setback for the government.\nThis obsession with GDP is relatively modern. As Daniel Susskind writes in his book Growth: A Reckoning, to be published next month, Adam Smith and Karl Marx both saw themselves as moral scientists rather than economists, a tradition that was abandoned in the second half of the 20th century. Today, \u201cpractical people who use economic ways of reasoning about the world are encouraged to flatten multidimensional moral questions like \u2018how should one live?\u2019 into simple technical ones, such as \u2018how can we increase GDP?\u2019,\u201d he writes.\nJudging by what she said in her Mais lecture, Reeves is aware of the drawbacks of GDP, noting that a model based on the pursuit of \u201cnarrow-based, narrowly shared growth\u201d would neither lead to higher living standards, nor command democratic consent.\nUnless Rishi Sunak makes the greatest comeback since Muhammed Ali floored George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle 50 years ago, Reeves is going to be this country\u2019s first female chancellor before long, so what she thinks matters. Labour\u2019s large and consistent opinion poll lead suggests voters have stopped listening to the Tories and are ready for change.\nReeves says she will improve Britain\u2019s growth rate \u2013 which has been weak since the global financial crisis of 2008. She has little time for those who say higher growth is not just undesirable but harmful to the planet, and insists what she is aiming for is rapid growth that benefits everybody and is environmentally sustainable. There can be no durable plan for economic stability and no sustainable plan for economic growth that is not also a serious plan for net zero, she says.\nThese aims are laudable. Until about 250 years ago, living standards for the average person had remained unchanged not just for hundreds but for thousands of years. For most people it was a short, miserable, subsistence existence. The higher levels of growth since the dawn of the industrial age mean people live longer, eat better and stay healthier than their forebears.\nSo when growth rates fall, as they have across the world since the financial crisis of 2008, it is clearly a concern. Slower growth means less tax revenue and less money on public services. Unless governments are prepared to break out of their self-imposed fiscal straitjackets and borrow more, which they are reluctant to do, growth offers a seemingly pain-free escape route.\nAsked in the question-and-answer section at the end of her Mais lecture whether she would \u201crun the economy hot\u201d, Reeves said that wouldn\u2019t be her approach. She will leave it up to the Bank of England to set interest rates and will run all her tax, spending and borrowing decisions past the Office for Budget Responsibility. There will be no attempt to replicate Joe Biden\u2019s subsidies to boost green industry because Britain lacks the US\u2019s fiscal firepower. Labour\u2019s flagship policy \u2013 the green prosperity plan \u2013 has been watered down. Instead, she says she can deliver faster growth by working on the structural problems of the economy: reforming the planning system, boosting investment and improving skills.\nLet\u2019s be clear. There are problems on the economy\u2019s supply side that need fixing, and Reeves\u2019s proposals might make a modest difference. But as Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, said in response to the Mais lecture, as yet they don\u2019t add up to a plan that would transform the economy.\n\u201cRipping up building regulations and tinkering in the public sector are not going to deliver serious growth \u2013 that\u2019s for the birds. Only sustained long-term public investment in our crumbling infrastructure can turn the tide on decline,\u201d Graham said.\nReeves has things going for her. Inflation is falling. Interest rates will be cut by the Bank of England in response. Recovery should be well under way by the time Labour comes to power. But then what? Green growth is certainly a desirable goal. Reeves has yet to show she can deliver it.\nLarry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor"},

But don\u2019t forget those who basked in his orbit", "author": "Aditya Chakrabortty", "teaser": "If the high-rollers surrounding the disgraced FTX founder had any qualms about taking his money, they didn\u2019t show it", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "Later today, a man who has recently turned 32 will be hauled in front of a Manhattan judge. Already convicted of huge fraud, he knows he\u2019s going to prison. The only question is for how long. If the US government gets its way, he will not emerge before his 80th birthday.\nThis is the final disgrace of Sam Bankman-Fried. The judge, politicians and the world\u2019s press will declare him one of the biggest swindlers in American history. They will note how within three years he built a marketplace for digital currencies, or crypto, that was worth around $32bn \u2013 and made himself the world\u2019s richest person under 30. Still it wasn\u2019t enough. He spent perhaps $8bn of his customers\u2019 savings on luxury homes, risky investments and whatever else took his fancy.\nBut remember this. Those same groups who today come to bury the boy billionaire yesterday praised him without qualification \u2013 and took as much of his cash as they could. While battling Donald Trump in 2020, Joe Biden received about $5m from Bankman-Fried. He wasn\u2019t alone. Mitt Romney, Cory Booker, Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi: they and so many other Democrats and Republicans accepted collectively tens of millions.\nAlso on the payroll to endorse Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading exchange, FTX, were celebrities and sports stars, from Larry David (who got a reported $10m to make one ad) to Gisele B\u00fcndchen and her then partner, the quarterback Tom Brady, the tennis player Naomi Osaka and the basketball legend Shaquille O\u2019Neal. If these high-rollers had the faintest qualm about taking huge sums from a young man who had dropped out of nowhere to head a business based in a tax haven, they didn\u2019t let it stop them taking his dollars.Less than a minute on Google will show you photos of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton at a conference organised by Bankman-Fried. At his invitation, the two statesmen had flown to the financiers\u2019 paradise of the Bahamas; there they sit, stiffly onstage in dark suits while the prodigy slouches in a grubby T-shirt and shorts. He may be less than half their age, but there is no doubt who\u2019s in charge, or who\u2019s picking up the tab. It was spring 2022, only months before Bankman-Fried was arrested and extradited back to the US.\nUp until then, the billionaire dined with Jeff Bezos and Leonardo DiCaprio. He hobnobbed with pop stars. Upon meeting, Katy Perry posted on Instagram: \u201cim quitting music and becoming an intern for @ftx_official ok.\u201d He was hosannaed on the covers of business magazines and a regular on American TV. The profiles depicted him as an idiot savant who slept next to his desk on a beanbag and worked amid day-old containers of chickpea korma.\nLess space was devoted to the $40m penthouse in which he actually lived, looking out on to a yacht-filled marina, or to his upbringing as the son of two Stanford Law professors, who\u2019d sent him to private school before the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Who wanted dreary old facts when you could have the American dream?\nAfter he was arrested and his bail was set at an almost-impossible $250m, they managed to raise the funds. Far too much was made of how he was amassing this fortune only to give it away, following a philosophy dubbed effective altruism. One journalist was savvy enough to do the maths and point out: \u201cSo far he\u2019s donated less to charity than he\u2019s spent on naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s arena.\u201d\nMore than hypocrisy by people who just wanted their next pay cheque, it helped to create his fortune. Among those who plunged millions into FTX were some of the biggest names in finance. One, a Silicon Valley firm called Sequoia Capital, not only gave its money: it ran a near-14,000 word hagiography of Bankman-Fried on its website. When things went south a few weeks later, the piece was taken down. But with typical generosity, the web has archived it. Among the highlights is how Sequoia\u2019s partners met Bankman-Fried over Zoom. They asked how he saw the future of FTX.\nRather than focus on the interview, Bankman-Fried is playing a video game, notes the piece. He says laconically: \u201cI want FTX to be a place where you can do anything you want with your next dollar. You can buy bitcoin. You can send money in whatever currency to any friend anywhere in the world. You can buy a banana.\u201d\nThen, the piece records: \u201cSuddenly, the chat window on Sequoia\u2019s side of the Zoom lights up with partners freaking out.\u201d\n\u201cI LOVE THIS FOUNDER,\u201d typed one partner \u2026 \u201cYES!!!\u201d exclaimed a second.\nAnother responded excitedly: \u201cI am a 10 out of 10.\u201d\nA pudding-faced boy in baggy shorts says he wants to buy a banana with internet money and some of the greatest minds in finance go wild. Just remember: it is this same class of geniuses in bodywarmers who Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves believe will finance our new green industries.\nIf in these stories you can hear echoes of Jay Gatsby, that is no accident. The Great Gatsby was published in 1925, amid one of the great financial bubbles in world history. Wall Street went bust in 1929, and when the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote his masterful history The Great Crash, 1929, he diagnosed how economically exuberant societies indulged the same financial crimes they would later drag into court. He called this \u201cthe bezzle\u201d.\n\u201cIn good times people are relaxed, trusting, and money is plentiful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut even though money is plentiful, there are always many people who need more. Under these circumstances the rate of embezzlement grows, the rate of discovery falls off, and the bezzle increases rapidly.\u201dWhen the crash comes, everything changes. \u201cMoney is watched with a narrow, suspicious eye. The man who handles it is assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise \u2026 The bezzle shrinks.\u201dAs Galbraith makes clear, financial crimes aren\u2019t purveyed only by evil masterminds. They are licensed by entire societies who believe in them \u2013 until they don\u2019t. Bankman-Fried\u2019s great fall from grace began shortly after US interest rates began marching upwards, in the summer of 2022.\nIn many ways, his story is of how an entire decade of cheap money and high hopes for a new economic paradigm was squandered. His crimes are his own to atone for. But his disgrace is the disgrace of a much larger financial and political establishment. The old guard spent years waiting for a new saviour to come along and rescue them from the doldrums of the banking crash. When a boy pulled up in a battered Corolla, they got in without asking too many questions.\nAditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Neglected, derided and exploited more than ever: why won\u2019t the UK protect those who rent a home?", "author": "John Harris", "teaser": "Millions face a perfect storm of rising demand, limited supply and politicians who don\u2019t really care enough to ease their plight ", "published": "Sun 24 Mar 2024 13.55 CET", "content": "Last week, a news story broke about the sheer impossibility of everyday living for millions of people all over the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average monthly rent paid by private tenants rose by 9% in the year to February, which is the largest annual increase since records began nine years ago. The average monthly rent in England is now \u00a31,276 and \u00a3944 in Scotland. If you are unfortunate enough to be renting from a landlord in London, your monthly outgoings may well appear hopelessly unrealistic: there, average monthly rents have risen by 10.6%, to a truly eye-watering \u00a32,035. Given that the median UK monthly wage currently sits at about \u00a32,200, the dire affordability crisis all this points to is glaringly clear.\nEverything, moreover, is woven through with a very British sense of the market\u2019s base cruelty: late last year, an investigation by the Observer found that the rents paid by tenants in the wealthiest parts of Britain had gone up by an average of 29% since 2019, whereas for people living in the most deprived areas, the figure was a mind-boggling 52%.\nIn our cities, skyrocketing rents are partly a subplot of the pandemic and its long tail: younger people either continued to live with their parents or moved back home during lockdowns, but are now returning to independent living en masse, thereby causing a spike in demand. At the same time, a crazy rental market and the impossibility of buying somewhere to live seem to be convincing existing tenants to stay put, meaning that supply is being choked off. The result \u2013 which is also playing out in the suburbs \u2013 is a vicious circle, exacerbated by thousands of landlords and letting agencies shoving up rents for both new and existing tenants, simply because they can.\nThe picture in more rural areas may be even more extreme. In 2023, one study claimed that private rents in the English countryside had gone up by an average of 27% in a single year. Again, the pandemic is relevant here: many out-of-town housing markets started to drastically change when families joined the great Covid migration out of urban places. The rampant conversion of homes into Airbnb-type holiday lets has only worsened the resulting pressures. In these places, one of the most obvious results is a quiet epidemic of rural homelessness, reportedly up 40% since 2018.\nAll told, whole swathes of our housing arrangements are in a state of flux, and with social housing still marginalised and property ownership off limits for millions of people, a private-rented sector that cannot cope with the resulting situation has long since turned dysfunctional. In England and Wales, around 5m households now live in private rented housing, up from less than 2m 25 years ago. Age-wise, the proportion of people who are tenants peaks at around 30% among 25- to 34-year-olds, although the number of people over 65 in such housing is reckoned to have increased by about 55% over the past decade. But the share of the national conversation given over to this part of housing policy is still pitifully small: the result, perhaps, of the stupid idea that renting is either something you do in your 20s, or the shameful last resort of older people who are down on their luck.\nThe old Tory vision of the property-owning democracy might be a nice idea, but it has long distorted and misdirected the politics of housing. If people in power fixate on the kind of homes that are bought and sold, the rental sector tends to look not like a part of the social fabric that needs to be reformed and improved, but something people should simply be encouraged to leave. Meanwhile, everything is further distorted by a plain fact that tends to go unmentioned. According to the campaign group 38 Degrees, nearly one in five Tory MPs are also private landlords, something else that makes our politics look almost Dickensian.\nThe sense of almost Victorian neglect is only heightened by how much these issues intersect with poverty. Around 1.9m households in the private rented sector receive an element of universal credit based on the so-called local housing allowance (LHA), which is meant to cover the cheapest third of rents in any given area. LHA was frozen in 2020, leaving rents to soar away from what people could afford. Late last year, Jeremy Hunt used his autumn statement to belatedly announce that it will rise, by an average of around 17%. But that does not solve any of the fundamental problems, for two obvious reasons. First, unless the LHA is uprated every year, it will inevitably fall behind increases in rents. Second, research suggests that even increased local LHA rates will not cover the asking rents for anything like the share of rental properties the government suggests: according to the property consultancy Savills, just 8.5% of such housing will actually be affordable for the relevant people.\nWhat a mess this all this. Nearly a quarter of private rented sector homes are still estimated to fail the decent homes standard. Arbitrary evictions seem to be soaring beyond control. The government\u2019s milquetoast renters reform bill, which was at least meant to outlaw that practice, has reportedly been waylaid by Tory interventions about \u201cthe rights of landlords\u201d, and may not make it through parliament before the election. In Scotland, the end of emergency rent caps and eviction protections for private renters at the end of March is forecast to cause huge problems: housing campaigners say they are already seeing cases of tenants being served with notice of rent increases of as much as 60%. The Labour party, in theory at least, has come up with a renters charter with solid and enduring protections for tenants, and plans to improve the standards of rented properties. There again, when Keir Starmer was asked last week if he supported the London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s drive to introduce modest rent controls, he gave a very characteristic answer: \u201cThat\u2019s not our national policy.\u201d\nAnd so here we are. We all know the essential nature of the contemporary British condition: that unending sense that nothing is reliable, even as we are told to shell out more and more money. The crisis in private rented housing might be the most grimly perfect example to date: the cost of one of life\u2019s most basic essentials endlessly going up, while the people who have to pay get no corresponding increase in everyday security and stability. These are the kind of things that eat away at what used to be called the social contract. If they are not fixed, the anger and resentment that has recently washed through our politics may only be the start.\n John Harris is a Guardian columnist"}

{"headline": "How can we save British nightlife from collapse? Look to Germany \u2013 and its football", "author": "Gilles Peterson", "teaser": "Small venues are the heart of our musical culture. Here\u2019s my two-pronged plan to keep that heart beating", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 14.22 CET", "content": "Grassroots venues are the foundation upon which the mighty British music industry has been built, fuelling the phenomenal level of talent this small island has produced. Yet while successive governments have shouted about how they are a shining demonstration of the country\u2019s creativity, the very same people have cut funding and opened the cultural sector to the most brutal market logic. Alongside government neglect, small venues across the country also face rising trade costs, pressure on disposable incomes, greedy property developers, post-pandemic changes in attitudes to communal experiences and the continuing shift towards an increasingly screen-based lifestyle.\nI cut my teeth DJing and dancing in small venues up and down the country, from my earliest experiences at Christie\u2019s, in Sutton \u2013 when I\u2019d head home after Carl Cox finished up as I had to be at school the next day \u2013 to a 10-year weekly Monday residency at Bar Rumba in Soho and many formative nights at the Hare &amp; Hounds in Birmingham. There are countless more \u2013 far too many to list them all. If it weren\u2019t for these backrooms, I would not be where I am today as a DJ. Nor would I have encountered (and still do!) those voices that push the culture forward and bring energy and positive momentum to our world.\nThe worry, of course, is that if these kinds of spaces disappear, we will end up with performances and DJ sets that all sound the same in places that all look the same, and where homogeneity becomes the status quo. The same sort of flattening of nuance is often levelled at algorithmically driven music discovery. And if this happens, we lose the joy of the unexpected find; the moment where you turn to the person next to you and laugh \u2013 what the jazz critic Whitney Balliett used to call \u201cthe sound of surprise\u201d.\nAnd that is why I think we should collectively work to preserve this special corner of our national makeup and fight against it fizzling out. The only way to do that is to open those spaces up and create access so that individuals can experience it for themselves. But to do that we also need to challenge some of the economic assumptions that govern these spaces.\nThe reality is that we live in a system where globally recognised names dominate the space and, albeit unwittingly, remove oxygen from those coming up. It is a bit like football. In the UK money has gone in at the top, resulting in the Premier League being the most lucrative in the world (with all the export value that brings); yet outside the elite clubs there is a real struggle to nurture and maintain grassroots clubs, as is often reported. Meanwhile in Germany there is a much more established practice of community ownership, with the 50+1 rule ensuring that the club\u2019s members always own a majority stake. It may be that the Bundesliga is less \u201cvaluable\u201d than the Premier League in monetary terms \u2013 but it makes it a more sustainable environment for the wider good of the game and places local communities at the heart of its financial stability.\nSo what can be done? To my mind there are two areas to focus on.\nFirst, we need to find new economic systems for funding these smaller clubs so they can thrive, not just barely survive. In an excellent piece published a couple of weeks ago by John Harris on the \u201cmagic and messy glory\u201d of Britain\u2019s nightlife, he suggested a small levy on tickets in arenas and stadiums, which could flow back to independent venues. This makes sense to me. But perhaps we could also look at models of community ownership and cooperative practices that could shore up the foundational layer of smaller venues, much like those football models from abroad. If we were to follow the lead of the German clubbing model we could also keep ticket prices and fees affordable to encourage entry \u2013 perhaps there is something to learn from this.\nSecond, we need to borrow the principles of the \u201ceach one teach one\u201d mantra of Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors \u2013 the organisation that rose up out of the 80s jazz generation with a mission to educate and elevate young musicians coming through. Without its work, the most recent UK jazz generation \u2013 think Ezra Collective, Nubya Garcia, Shabaka Hutchings, Kokoroko and many more \u2013 might not have reached the heights they have, proving yet again the importance of education, funding and deep knowledge that only the grassroots can bring.\nWith all this in mind, this year I am going to redouble my efforts to play at small UK clubs as I have been doing \u2013 places like the Golden Lion in Todmorden, Cosmic Slop in Leeds, Sub Club in Glasgow. The aim is to keep shining a light on these special places and hopefully bring in audiences old and new in a way that gives back some of what they have given me and countless others. I am also going to gather those stories and use the media at my disposal to share them more widely.\nI hope that through this journey to engage in a wider conversation about the importance of smaller venues. There will always be a section of the population drawn to the transcendental communal experience of dance and the \u201cmagic and mess\u201d of seeing live music up close and in the flesh. But these life-affirming experiences \u2013 life-defining in my case \u2013 need the places and spaces to carry them. That is why I am determined to fight for their survival. I\u2019ll hope you\u2019ll join me.\nGilles Peterson is a DJ, broadcaster and founder of Brownswood Recordings"},

It isn\u2019t \u2013 just the mushrooms grown with peat, to protect plover and dragonfly habitats. (And the Trust\u2019s tearooms have sourced alternatives grown in other ways.) This tells you all you need to know about the obsessive campaigns against the Trust run by opaquely funded rightwing thinktanks and their allies in the press \u2013 in particular, how much they are rooted in reality.\nSo it was good to hear the historian and national treasure Mary Beard, while giving the Trust\u2019s Octavia Hill lecture last week, take apart some of the moaners\u2019 pet peeves. A derided 2020 report into links between National Trust properties and colonisation and slavery was, she said, \u201cstating the bleeding obvious\u201d.

{"headline": "Putin\u2019s lethally negligent failure can\u2019t be covered up. The Moscow attack leaves him weaker than ever", "author": "Simon Tisdall", "teaser": "The mask of invincibility is slipping ever further, and eventually that will matter. This debacle won\u2019t be forgiven or forgotten", "published": "Mon 25 Mar 2024 13.32 CET", "content": "Each time Vladimir Putin messes up, the same question is asked: will it make any difference? Last week\u2019s terrorist attack on the Crocus City concert hall near Moscow, which killed 137 people, is one of the bigger crises Putin has faced in his 25-year rule. There is no doubt that he, as Russia\u2019s head of state and overall chief of its security forces, bears ultimate responsibility for what was by any measure a catastrophic failure. In any normal political system, his resignation would be expected.\nThe fact this is more or less unimaginable is not necessarily a sign of Putin\u2019s strength. His dictatorship has eviscerated checks and balances within Russian society, eliminating means of independent scrutiny. Any call for him to take personal responsibility would barely be heard, let alone acted on. Yet the Russian people, while chronically misled and serially misinformed, are not stupid.\nWith blood on the streets and a nation in mourning, there\u2019s no hiding that the Putin superman myth just took a serious, bubble-bursting beating.\nThe Kremlin is estimated to have spent more than \u00a31bn on \u201cinformation management\u201d, meaning lies and propaganda, to ensure Putin\u2019s recent presidential election \u201cvictory\u201d. In addition, there was a reported 20-fold increase in state spending on internet and media. All this had a single aim: to portray Putin as an invincible, indispensable modern-day tsar who bravely protects Mother Russia from her enemies.\nYet on Friday, four gunmen comprehensively demolished that myth in an anarchic frenzy of merciless violence. The attackers were unopposed, the victims had no warning, and all of Putin\u2019s huge security apparatus \u2013 all this usurper king\u2019s horses and men \u2013 were unable to stop the butchering of defenceless citizens.\nEven in a society as tied down as Russia\u2019s, this lethally negligent failure will not be forgotten or forgiven.\nThat\u2019s on Putin. And it points to another fundamental weakness in his personal and political position: he is so out of touch, so isolated from day-to-day Russian realities, that he believes his own mendacious narratives. Despite explicit videos published online by Islamic State, which has admitted that it undertook the attack, Putin persists in blaming Ukrainian \u201cNazis\u201d. This is beyond cynical. It\u2019s borderline psychotic.\nThere is not a jot of evidence to support this deranged calumny, fiercely denied in Kyiv. Yet it\u2019s no surprise. Unsubstantiated conspiracy theories are Putin\u2019s stock in trade. The expectation is that the Kremlin, not satisfied with the recent murder of leading regime critic Alexei Navalny, will exploit the attack to further suppress domestic dissent, expand political controls, escalate the Ukraine war, even order a mass mobilisation.\nIf Putin is incapable of telling, or at least of accepting, the difference between reality and make-believe, it\u2019s because he himself squats atop an edifice of lies. His power and his presidency are based on systemic falsehoods, fed daily to a captive nation on an epic scale. The basic contract, as it is sometimes called, between Putin and the people is that he delivers security and they deliver support. Yet this is the biggest lie of all.\nPutin does not give a damn for the security and the wellbeing of ordinary Russians. At Crocus City, the big lie was cruelly exposed. As innocent people died or writhed in agony, Putin silently skulked, sulked and schemed for 19 hours about how best to dodge the blame and spin the fallout.\nHis selfish, cold-eyed insouciance has been witnessed again and again. Remember his callous attempts to ignore the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000 and the carnage he oversaw during the second siege of Grozny. Most recently it has led to the stupidest geostrategic blunder of modern times \u2013 his inept invasion of Ukraine \u2013 and resulting mass Russian casualties. He just doesn\u2019t care.\nWith Putin, it\u2019s always all about him, about his own insecurity, his need for absolute power, his delusions of revived Russian imperial grandeur. It\u2019s never about other people, let alone \u201cthe people\u201d.\nThe damage done to Russia by Putin\u2019s war and the standoff with the west, in terms of lives, treasure and reputation, is incalculable. Yet it\u2019s his abiding obsession. Everything he thinks and does appears related to it. Speaking after this month\u2019s election, he vowed yet again to make it his main focus. Why? Because, deep in his shrivelled, desiccated heart, he knows it was a terrible mistake.\nMost Russians, understandably, do not share Putin\u2019s obsession. Instead they see, with growing clarity, the harm his war does to their families, their living standards, their shrinking freedoms, their personal safety. Regime-manipulated polls are misleading. Many Russians want it to end. Their silence is not consent, nor does it signify approval. It is rooted in fear.\nPutin is vulnerable. He should have seen the terrorists\u2019 attack coming. But arrogance and complacency blinded him. When the US generously shared an explicit heads-up about an imminent plot, he dismissed it as a disinformation ploy. When the security services should have been tracking Islamist militants, they were harassing opponents, journalists and gay people on his orders.\nPutin has remade the Russian state in his own image: brutal, incompetent, ignorant, distrustful, delusional and isolated. It is fundamentally weak, as is he. Incrementally, as one calamity succeeds another, his grip slips, his authority weakens and fear of him dissipates. The Crocus City atrocity will accelerate this process. It does make a difference.\nBy helping shatter the altar screen of mythical omniscience behind which he cowers like a defrocked priest, it has forced Putin one more step down the road towards a final reckoning. It\u2019s coming, do not doubt it. It\u2019s coming.\nSimon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s foreign affairs commentator\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Judges who belong to the Garrick have a choice: play fair by women, or stand down from rape and sexism cases ", "author": "Karon Monaghan", "teaser": "Judging requires an appearance of neutrality. But members of this elitist club are signalling their commitment to patriarchy", "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 15.12 CET", "content": "Nobody sensible believes that judges do not bring their prejudices to work but we, as lawyers, and no doubt the public, expect that judges will make an effort to keep them hidden.\nMost judges will have to decide a sex discrimination case or preside over a rape or sexual or domestic violence trial at one time or another in their career. When they do, they may well have to remind themselves and sometimes juries of the position of women in society, and counter gender stereotypes that might otherwise influence the outcome of the case. These stereotypes might be those that associate women with certain forms of work, caring for children or doing \u201cwomanly\u201d things (like not going out drinking in cosy clubs in the evening), or gender-related rape myths that blame women for men\u2019s sexual assaults upon them. Judges are supposed to do this \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d.\nBut the publication this week of the names of a number of judges who are members of the Garrick Club casts doubt on the inclination or ability of some of them to keep to this promise. The revelations come as no surprise to many lawyers and, indeed, other judges. Many past and present members of the judiciary are members of the Garrick, and the legal profession has always known this to be the case. From time to time, there are grumblings; some lawyers argue that judges should be prohibited from joining men-only clubs.\nLeaving aside gut feeling \u2013 the general queasiness at the image conjured up by the words \u201cprivate gentleman\u2019s club\u201d (whether Spearmint Rhino or the Garrick) \u2013 even lawyers sometimes struggle to pinpoint quite what is wrong with them. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to single-sex clubs. Women should be allowed to meet without the interruption of men. Lesbians should be able to have their own places in which to socialise and mobilise. Single-sex spaces are important, especially given that women often experience hostility or harassment in mixed-sex environments.\nBut the Garrick is not an ordinary club, and herein lies the problem. It is not a club where men with a shared heritage, or gay men, for example, meet for solidarity or for comfort. The Garrick is different. It is a place where powerful men hang out, forge relationships and work out who they can trust. Women lose out on the opportunity (should they wish to take it) of making those relationships and engendering trust among those they wish to have trust them. But more fundamentally, judges being members sends a message, including to female lawyers and judges, that powerful places are manly places.\nIt is not clear how you join the Garrick or, apart from being male, what the criteria are for membership. Its homepage tells the reader that its entry requirements are strict: \u201cIt would be better that 10 unobjectionable men should be excluded than one terrible bore should be admitted.\u201d This, we are told, means \u201cthe lively atmosphere for which the Club was so well-known in the 19th century continues to invigorate members of the Club in the 21st century\u201d.\nPerhaps the more than a third of members who obstructed the efforts of some who sought to have its constitution amended to admit women (a two-thirds majority being required) thought women who might have an interest in joining would not be sufficiently entertaining. Or perhaps they relied on prejudiced ideas about women\u2019s wittiness, competence, or trustworthiness. Or perhaps they simply did not want women, including female lawyers and judges, to enter a space reserved for the powerful. We cannot know. Nor do we know who voted to keep women out. Not that that would be any excuse. Serious dissatisfaction with a club\u2019s rules can easily be dealt with by relinquishing membership. We can take it that those who continue to be members do so content in the knowledge that their professional peers are excluded because of their sex.\nThis tells us a lot about those whose membership was exposed by the Guardian\u2019s Amelia Gentleman this week: from senior politicians to civil servants. But for judges there is an additional problem. Judging requires the appearance of neutrality. Membership of a club that functions to foster relationships between men at the centres of power, and that bars women from entry as members (though not presumably as cleaners and cooks), sends a message of partiality: a commitment to patriarchy.\nThe apparent determination by members of the judiciary to hang on to membership means that the criticism that is lobbed at them from time to time is not enough. Judges who are members of the Garrick should not be presiding over cases where sex or gender is a focal point in the case, as in discrimination cases and sexual and domestic violence cases. They cannot be trusted to be impartial or at the very least to be seen to be so.\nIf they cannot trust women to sit with them in the clubby corridors of power, we cannot trust them to do the right thing by women. Advocates must now seriously consider whether in some cases it might be appropriate to ask a judge whether he is a member of the Garrick and, if so, to ask that he recuse himself so that justice can be seen to be done.\nKaron Monaghan KC is a barrister specialising in equality and human rights law"},
{"headline": "There are more than 1,000 varieties of banana, and we eat one of them. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s absurd", "author": "Dan Saladino", "teaser": "The lack of diversity could mean the fruit\u2019s extinction. It offers a stark warning of what could happen to other key foods", "published": "Fri 22 Mar 2024 13.00 CET", "content": "The meeting of the World Banana Forum last week in Rome didn\u2019t make many headlines. But what was under discussion there has serious implications for everyone. The ubiquitous yellow fruit is the proverbial canary in the mine of our modern food system, showing just how fragile it is. And the current plight of the banana should serve as an invitation to us all to become champions of food diversity.\nWhen you peel a banana, you\u2019re on the receiving end of a near-miraculous $10bn supply chain. One that sends seemingly endless quantities of a tropical fruit halfway across the world to be among the cheapest, most readily available products in supermarket aisles (on average, around 12p a banana). But, incredibly, there\u2019s no inbuilt backup plan or safety net if the one variety that most of the global trade depends on starts to fail.\nThe most striking point made at this year\u2019s forum came in a seemingly innocuous comment in the event\u2019s opening speech. The director general of the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation, Dr Qu Dongyu, questioned why, with more than 1,000 known varieties of banana, the world mostly depends on just one, a species called the Cavendish. That needs to change, he said, hinting that we are all part of the problem.\nMost people don\u2019t question why every banana they\u2019ve ever eaten looks and tastes pretty much the same. Most of us will never try a blue java from Indonesia with its soft, unctuous texture and flavour of vanilla ice-cream, or the Chinese banana that is so aromatic it\u2019s been given the name go san heong, meaning \u201cyou can smell it from the next mountain\u201d. The demand for low-cost, high-yielding varieties has resulted in vast monocultures of just one type of globally traded banana, and this is true of many other crops as well. Homogeneity in the food system is a risky strategy, because it reduces our ability to adapt in a rapidly changing world.\nUnlike wild bananas, which grow from seed, every single Cavendish is a clone, the offspring of a slice of the plant\u2019s suckers growing below ground. This means it has no way of evolving, so it can\u2019t adapt to new threats that arise in the environment. Panama disease, also known as fusarium wilt, is whipping through monocultures of Cavendish bananas in Asia, Australia, Africa and, most recently, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the source of 80% of the world\u2019s traded bananas. Just a few spores carried on a spade or even on clothing is all it takes to contaminate a plantation, and growing the Cavendish on that land is no longer an option.\nOne solution in the face of this devastating disease is to use genetic modification or gene-editing to develop bananas with greater resistance. James Dale, a professor at Queensland University of Technology, spent decades working on a modified version of the Cavendish designed to be \u201chighly resistant\u201d to the variant of Panama disease that\u2019s attacking the Cavendish. But Dale believes it\u2019s not a magic bullet. The long-term answer, he thinks, is to bring greater diversity into the food system.\nDuring the research for my book Eating to Extinction, a conversation with Dale proved revelatory. Monocultures do not exist in nature, he told me, and we need to learn lessons from this. Much greater diversity used to exist in the global food system. But in introducing a smaller number of highly productive crops, this diversity was lost. In response to this, scientists at the UK\u2019s leading crop research centres, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) in Cambridge and the John Innes Centre in Norwich, are working to bring diversity back into the fields using genetics from heritage varieties that were pushed to the brink of extinction by modern varieties.\nScientists are looking at other precarious crops, such as coffee, which is made up of varieties that emerged from just a handful of plants sent around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries. The climate crisis is making the future of the coffee species we depend on \u2013 arabica and robusta \u2013 look bleak. This is why botanists at Kew have identified viable and delicious alternatives from the more than 120 other coffee species around the world. The most promising is Coffea stenophylla, a species found in Sierra Leone that almost went extinct in the 1950s.\nAt a policy level, there are reasons to be optimistic. At Cop15, held in December 2022 in Montreal, 196 countries signed up to the Global Biodiversity Framework. The headline pledge is to save 30% of nature on land and sea by 2030, part of which includes urgent action to \u201chalt extinction of threatened species\u201d. Less well known is the fact that these threatened species also include domesticated ones, referring to the 7,000 or so plants humans have used for food over millennia.\nAnd there are farmers\u2019 initiatives such as Wildfarmed, which is experimenting with a wider range of wheat varieties. The flour is already finding its way on to the high street through major retailers and nationwide pizza chains. Meanwhile, in the east of England, Hodmedod\u2019s, a business set up by three food and farming researchers, is looking back to what was grown in Britain during the iron age and reviving neglected varieties of grains and pulses, including carlin peas and emmer wheat.\nBut if Qu Dongyu is right that a big problem is the lack of \u201cacceptance by retailers and consumers of different varieties\u201d, we all need to step up. We need to let it be known that we want greater diversity. This rallying call could be as simple as buying a variety of bean or pea we haven\u2019t tried before, an unusual type of wheat, or even \u2013 if one were to appear in store \u2013 a different banana.\nDan Saladino is a food journalist, broadcaster and author of Eating to Extinction: The World\u2019s Rarest Foods and Why We Need to Save Them"},
{"headline": "Chumbawamba wrote Tubthumping as a working-class anthem. We won\u2019t have it stolen by the right", "author": "Boff Whalley", "teaser": "Why do populists so often use the work of artists who despise them? Because they don\u2019t have any good songs of their own", "published": "Sat 23 Mar 2024 08.00 CET", "content": "The beauty of writing a song that revolves around a universal idea is that people feel like it could be theirs: it voices the way they\u2019re feeling. The first time I heard my band Chumbawamba\u2019s hit Tubthumping played at the ground of my local football club, I was standing at the urinal in the toilet underneath the stands, pissing the afternoon away with scores of other blokes, ready for the match. I walked up to my seat and watched people singing along to what had instantly become, in that moment at least, their song.\nTubthumping belongs to the guests at the wedding who sing it in celebration. It belongs to the Italian anti-fascists who sing it in defiance on a demonstration. It belongs to cancer patients going through chemotherapy, seeing every successful bout of treatment as a personal victory. I know that all these people have taken the song as theirs, because they write to tell us. This is how songs become \u201cfolk songs\u201d: songs that belong to our shared histories, not to a single version performed by a single artist.\nThere are hundreds of songs like this, songs that feel as if they belong to us all. When we sing Fairytale of New York at Christmas, the let\u2019s-all-join-in spirit of it isn\u2019t the sole property of Shane, Kirsty and the Pogues \u2013 it\u2019s our song, too.\nBut there\u2019s a problem with these universal songs \u2013 they can be hijacked by people who clearly don\u2019t understand the spirit in which they were written, and want to use them to aggrandise themselves, or to sell ideas that aren\u2019t universal at all. It\u2019s like baking a cake and declaring to the room: \u201cHere, have a slice, the cake is for all of us!\u201d And some greedy bastard grabs five or six slices and scurries off into a dark corner, sniggering. And to stretch that analogy, the greedy bastard is the person that, noticeably, never turns up with his own cake for everyone to share.\nBecause that\u2019s the thing with songs, with literature, with art, theatre, cinema, with most of the beautiful, creative, cultural things we love \u2013 they are very rarely created by those on the political right. The bigots don\u2019t have any good songs of their own.\nWhich brings me to New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister Winston Peters and his use of Tubthumping. The man is clearly modelling himself on the recent upsurge of populist politicians, these ultra-wealthy men somehow getting to claim to be \u201cof the people\u201d. Across the globe, from Italy to Sweden and from Jair Bolsonaro to Donald Trump, these self-styled \u201coutsiders\u201d are gaining power and popularity using slogans that appeal to ordinary people, slogans that make no sense when you put them in the mouths of millionaire careerists. Their rhetoric is anti-elite, and yet they clearly and definably are the elite. Their popularity depends upon them playing at being just like you and me, the good guy at the bar who buys you a drink while you\u2019re watching the football, who tells you the reason the country is going down the drain isn\u2019t because of the multibillionaire corporate hoarding of the world\u2019s wealth but because \u2026 cue a culture-warrior rant about immigration and snowflakes and experts and \u201cI did my own research\u201d.\nLet me be clear: the song Tubthumping was written to celebrate the resilience and tenacity of working-class folk who keep fighting when the chips are down. It has nothing whatsoever in common with wealthy politicians with extremist anti-liberal agendas.\nThere have been many, many examples of rightwing populist leaders using ostensibly leftwing music to hoodwink their audiences into some kind of hypnotic self-delusion that they are \u201cof the people\u201d. The Conservative party has a history of being called out for singing and playing songs by leftwing artists at its annual party conference. From a rendition of John Lennon\u2019s Imagine in the Thatcher years (is it possible to be that oblivious to irony?) to a more recent use of M People\u2019s Moving On Up (apparently the song\u2019s co-writer, Mike Pickering, was \u201cvery angry\u201d), it\u2019s as if these careerist politicians think we won\u2019t notice that their jukebox is stuffed full of songs by artists who despise them and their ideas.\nFormer Tory prime minister David Cameron listed one of his favourite songs as the Jam\u2019s Eton Rifles which prompted the Jam\u2019s Paul Weller to retort \u201cWhich bit didn\u2019t you get? \u2026 It wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.\u201d When Cameron also admitted to liking the Smiths, guitarist Johnny Marr said simply: \u201cStop saying that you like The Smiths, no you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s as if the new breed of populist leaders think they can hide their multimillionaire \u201cman of the people\u201d contradictions behind such universally loved songs. Trump is particularly ignorant when it comes to his choice of campaign songs; he\u2019s been forced to stop using music by artists including Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, the Beatles and Elton John. Chumbawamba had to send our own \u201ccease and desist\u201d when a pre-president Trump thought he could use Tubthumping without realising we would loudly object. Which all makes it all the more obvious that, simply, the right doesn\u2019t have any good songs. That\u2019s why they keep trying to nick ours.\nBoff Whalley is a musician and writer, and the former lead guitarist of Chumbawamba"},
{"headline": "Look at streets and open spaces: where are all the children? Blame the war on play", "author": "Harriet Grant", "teaser": "It\u2019s said that youngsters are addicted to tech \u2013 but their childhoods are also being shaped by the loss of child-friendly areas", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 12.00 CET", "content": "Something has gone seriously wrong for children in the UK. On the radio, in the papers, among friends; everyone is talking about the epidemic of childhood unhappiness and anxiety. Smartphones, social media, and easy access to violent content and pornography are, of course, part of it. The rising tide of anger at under-regulated tech companies is justified. But there has been another huge change to childhood in recent years \u2013 the almost total loss of children and their play from the streets and neighbourhoods around us.\nChildren and their games, their scooters, their chalks and bouncing balls have vanished, replaced by speeding traffic and parked cars. And in losing doorstep play, children have lost the hours of exploration and physical activity that nature designed them to seek out in order to thrive. This, along with the slow erosion of time for play in schools and the austerity-driven closure of youth spaces, is profoundly changing childhood.\nI know this because for the past five years I have been reporting around the country on the war on play. It\u2019s a war that, sadly, children and the adults fighting for them are in danger of losing.\nIn 2019, I reported on the scandal of segregated playgrounds. Developers on several new-build estates in London were deliberately blocking children in social housing from shared play spaces and gardens. The segregation was appalling, and led to widespread political condemnation. But I believe it was only possible because of a much deeper injustice.\nPlay was already starting to be seen as a form of antisocial behaviour. Children and their play have been pushed off the streets and estates where they grow up, through increased traffic and a \u201cno ball games\u201d culture. With other communal spaces no longer home to crowds of children, it became easy to segregate the tiny spaces allotted for play.\nThe government cannot continue to ignore this issue. Yesterday saw the final session of a parliamentary inquiry into children, young people and the built environment. MPs on the select committee that scrutinises the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities have been hearing evidence since January on how we can plan and develop for children\u2019s needs rather than against them.\nYesterday, the inquiry questioned the minister for planning Lee Rowley. He and the government\u2019s chief planner, Joanna Averley, were pressed repeatedly on why children are missing from planning guidance. \u201cWe know they are less important than bats,\u201d pointed out the MP for Dover, Natalie Elphicke.\nBut both Averley and Rowley stuck to their guns. Children, said Rowley, do not need any further mention in planning. \u201cYou could then say disabled people need mentioning, or people from certain geographic areas.\u201d His priority, he said, is to get homes built.\nSo that\u2019s the government view: more homes, and no mention of children in planning. Rowley added, \u201cAs far as I can see, things have improved for children in terms of play provision \u2013 I can\u2019t provide evidence but I\u2019m sure they have.\u201d And with that comment, he dismissed the pages of evidence presented to the inquiry that shows the vanishing of children from their own streets in recent years \u2013 and the huge cuts to local authority play budgets.\nI gave evidence in the first session alongside Alice Ferguson, co-founder with Ingrid Skeels and Amy Rose of Playing Out, the parent-led movement that started with just one play street in Bristol and has grown into a national campaign to restore children\u2019s freedom to play out near home. It is partly down to their dogged lobbying that this inquiry is taking place. This is real people power \u2013 from play streets to parliament.\nAs thousands of homes and new developments spring up around the country, change is urgently needed. The National Planning Policy Framework mentions lorries more often than children \u2013 newts and bats are better protected than play.\nTwo other key experts in this area are the architect Dinah Bornat and writer Tim Gill. Both are advocates of child-friendly design, working with leading developers to promote doorstep play and neighbourhoods where children are free to move around, safe from traffic. But in the February evidence session, led by Labour MP Clive Betts, both made stark warnings that children are \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d in planning.\nWhat campaigners would like to see come out of this fiasco is a cross-departmental approach to consider children\u2019s needs in every area of public life. This could be led by a cabinet level minister for children.\nIn terms of planning \u2013 all new developments should be child-friendly, and existing neighbourhoods adapted with child-friendly measures.\nHousing associations and local councillors need clear guidance to refer to so that when they get complaints about play (and they do get these complaints), they can write back, stating clearly that children have a right to play near their own homes.\nAgain and again, I have seen the impact of this lack of consideration in children\u2019s lives.\nI recently wrote about residents on the Bells Gardens Estate in Peckham. Southwark council ran out of money after ripping out their playground during redevelopment, and have left the site covered in rubble.. There is no law or policy that protects play spaces in situations like these.\nJust down the road in New Cross, south London, children at Kender primary school waited several years while the Peabody housing association used their much-loved park to store building materials. While at a high-end development near Tower Bridge, I met families living in social housing flats who were sent warning letters for letting their children play in the corridors.\nIn Rhyl, one of the poorest parts of Wales, developers working for the council ripped out a much-loved playground to make way for flood defences, with local families complaining of a \u201cshameful\u201d lack of consultation. A furious local resident wrote to me \u201cthe impact of the development on local sea life was discussed more than the impact on children\u201d.\nThis extends beyond local government and developers. It seems we have turned against play across society. When the Guardian did a call-out on the barriers children face playing outside, families told us of threats from neighbours and even of police being called about children for playing outside.\nSo while it is true that being online is harming children\u2019s mental health, we need to also focus on what children do actually need \u2013 and that is as much free outdoor play on their doorsteps as possible.\nHarriet Grant is a freelance reporter specialising in human rights and social affairs"},

{"headline": "Does China spy on Britain? Of course. But we have more important things to discuss with them", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "teaser": "While diplomatic rows are inevitable, the priority is to keep channels open,  and engage with Beijing about the climate crisis", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "Once upon a time Britain would have sent a gunboat up the Yangtze River. That would teach those Chinese a lesson. To hear some MPs talk about Beijing\u2019s espionage activities, you would think gunboats were already on their way.\nOf course, it is malicious and hurtful for a foreign state patently to hack into Britain\u2019s Electoral Commission and target senior parliamentarians \u2013 as the government on Monday claimed China did in 2021. It is equally malicious to fabricate MPs\u2019 emails and use a Commons researcher as an informant. No less evil is the culture of fear sown among Britain\u2019s 150,000 Chinese students by agents of Beijing, albeit tolerated by British universities greedy for money.\nHow to react is another matter. Rishi Sunak was quick to the fray. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that the situation now is that China is behaving in an increasingly assertive way abroad, authoritarian at home, and it represents an epoch-defining challenge, and also the greatest state-based threat to our economic security,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s right that we take measures to protect ourselves, which is what we are doing.\u201d That was clear. It was also ridiculous. On Sunday night, an equally absurd BBC political bubble programme, the Westminster Hour on Radio 4, seemed to regard war as at hand. MPs demanded that the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, \u201ccall out China\u201d, rather as though it had broken a Garrick Club rule. Beijing was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. There should be \u201cconsequences\u201d. The Yangtze gunboat was clearing its decks.\nBut ahead of that, Dowden was indeed having his say. There will be a reckoning, he promised MPs, more sanctions. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, who is said to have been targeted alongside other parliamentarians in the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, was also blunt. China is not just a challenge to us, he said. It must be framed as a threat. \u201cAs they grow in power and potency, we are shrinking before them,\u201d he said.\nStill, I doubt if this gets even a news-in-brief in the People\u2019s Daily. Britain\u2019s parliament cannot be a big deal in the hierarchy of Beijing security. The fulminations of Duncan Smith will hardly have had the People\u2019s Liberation Army straining at the leash. It is sound and fury, much like at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when any British minister meeting a Chinese host was told always \u201cto raise issues concerning Uyghur human rights\u201d. A Chinese acquaintance told me it became comical, \u201clike the Brits saying grace or asking about the weather\u201d.\nBritish diplomacy still exists in a mist of lost imperial power. China, meanwhile, is expanding its global influence exactly as the west once did. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) now extends across Asia, Africa and Europe. Its investments have advanced China\u2019s interests but also the lives of those it assists. BRI has, incidentally, been much to the gain of the City of London, in construction, banking, insurance and professional services. Realpolitik is how it works. The fate of the Uyghurs never stopped David Cameron and George Osborne begging for Chinese cash for power stations and railways; business was business.\nToday the world\u2019s relations with China are in one area crucial. That country is responsible for more than a quarter of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and rising. Britain is now actively participating in China\u2019s proposed \u201cgreening\u201d of its BRI programme, which is largely about infrastructure. Given that a third of all greenhouse gas emissions are from construction \u2013 a fact still ignored by British planning policy \u2013 this collaboration with China is central to fighting the climate crisis. It is not about diplomatic posturing. It is about something essential.\nThe reality is that all states spy on each other, mostly to no effect and at vast cost. Nothing justifies hacking other people\u2019s emails, but a helping of public outrage and a few Chinese diplomats sent packing should be enough to restore Westminster\u2019s machismo. It is also clear that international action is needed to police the darker regions of the digital universe, where the entire world is wandering without a candle.\nBut, for all these concerns, a sense of proportion remains the hardest but most necessary quality to maintain in international relations.

{"headline": "The Guardian view on Evan Gershkovich\u2019s year behind bars: Moscow should free him now", "teaser": "The Wall Street Journal correspondent is not a spy. He is a journalist, and should be released immediately from his Russian jail", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.38 CET", "content": "Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, has spent nearly a year in a Moscow prison, awaiting trial for a crime he did not commit. Mr Gershkovich was arrested last March in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and jailed on espionage charges. He is not a spy. He is a journalist, and should be released immediately. Hostage diplomacy lies behind his incarceration. As the US ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, said, Mr Gershkovich\u2019s case \u201cis not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends\u201d.\nVladimir Putin indicated in February that a prisoner exchange could lead to the release of Mr Gershkovich. There have been high-profile prisoner swaps in the past. In December 2022, Moscow traded a US basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia for a Russian arms trafficker. But a journalist\u2019s detention to secure the release of a Russian hitman would underscore Russia\u2019s retreat into a Soviet past. In 1986 an American journalist, Nicholas Daniloff, was arrested and charged with espionage. He was let go after two weeks when the US released a Soviet diplomat accused of spying. Mr\u00a0Gershkovich has been inside for nearly 12 months.\nRussia has turned away in the last decade from liberal democratic institutions such as a multiparty system, fair elections and a free press. These had taken root after the collapse of the Soviet Union but were unlikely to spring fully grown, like Athena from\u00a0the forehead of Zeus, given a history of tsarist and communist authoritarianism. After last Friday\u2019s horrific concert hall terror attacks outside Moscow,\u00a0western nations rightly stood with the Russian people. Releasing Mr Gershkovich would earn Mr\u00a0Putin\u2019s regime global goodwill when its fragility is in the spotlight.\nIn Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo jail, Mr Gershkovich has kept up his spirits by reading books and letters of support. Journalism is not a crime. Mr Gershkovich was fully accredited to report on Russia, and was doing his job when he was detained. He should never have been imprisoned. But the definition of espionage in Russia is so absurdly broad that the authorities can interpret reporting as spying. The country keeps a disproportionate number of foreign reporters behind bars. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says 12 of the global total of 17 non-local imprisoned journalists are held by Russia. Many foreign correspondents have left the country or been denied visas, and their dwindling numbers constrain those who remain even further.\nFor many Russian reporters, the profession turned deadly long ago. According to the CPJ, 43\u00a0journalists and media workers have been killed in Russia since Mr Putin came to power in 1999. Reporting that could be contrary to the state\u2019s narrative is now effectively illegal. The climate of fear has driven many Russian journalists out of the country they love.\nMany in Russia know that the defence of the free word offers inspiration to posterity. The list of\u00a0those, famous and anonymous, who struggled for\u00a0a free press in the country is a long one. Censorship will disfigure the nation\u2019s intellectual and cultural life. Mr Gershkovich understood this very well. \u201cReporting on Russia is now also a regular practice of watching people you know get locked away for years,\u201d he tweeted in 2022. Eight months later, he was in prison. His detention has been extended until 30 June, prolonging his nightmare. Moscow should set him free now.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "The Guardian view on unpaid care: time to heed Kate and Derek\u2019s story", "teaser": "Let us hope Kate Garraway\u2019s films spark a national conversation and serious change. Society is nothing without care", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.42 CET", "content": "It is an extraordinary story, it is an ordinary tragedy. Kate Garraway\u2019s documentaries about caring for her late husband, Derek Draper, have drawn huge publicity\u00a0and millions of viewers. That is partly testimony to the celebrity of the couple \u2013 a TV presenter and a New Labour politico \u2013 but it is mostly due to the power of their story. Covid ravaged every organ in Mr Draper\u2019s body so that, in the programme aired this week, viewers saw this vibrant, sharp-witted man confined to a bed, struggling to walk or to form sentences. \u201cHis brain was his best friend,\u201d Ms Garraway remarked at one point. \u201cNow it is like his brain is his enemy.\u201d Meanwhile, the work of caring for him pushed\u00a0 her to the edge financially, psychologically, even physically. The stress was so severe that she developed heart pains that forced her to attend hospital.Even amid this intimate suffering, Ms Garraway knows there are millions of other households in similar situations \u2013 except without her profile, access to expertise or high salary. Among the programme\u2019s most moving sections are the testimonies from other carers about negotiating bureaucracy and trying to manage. They borrow money from friends and family, they go to food banks, they are \u201cjust existing\u201d. The last census from 2021 found that 5 million people provide unpaid care to a loved one.\nThat is a sizable jump from a decade ago, and carers\u2019 organisations believe the current total is higher still \u2013 perhaps 10 million \u2013 after Covid. Yet they are practically invisible in our political conversation. Ministers and economists note that nearly 3\u00a0million\u00a0people are now long-term sick and worry about the impact on our labour force \u2013 but no one asks about the people looking after them.\nNews bulletins will regularly feature stories on the desperate erosion of the NHS and the crisis in social care \u2013 yet they rarely look into the lives of wives, husbands, sons and daughters who step in where the state has failed. Provision for these people, who do some of the most important work\u00a0in Britain\u00a0today, is almost risible. Carer\u2019s allowance\u00a0is\u00a0pitifully low, while parliament has only just granted employees a week\u2019s care leave a year \u2013 unpaid, naturally. Much of this neglect is age-old sexism, predicated\u00a0on the belief that it is women who will pick up the pieces, and they don\u2019t merit much attention. This is nonsense. If voluntary carers were\u00a0to withdraw their labour tomorrow, hospitals and council services would suffer an almighty deluge. They won\u2019t, of course. In sickness and in health, runs the old wedding vow, and for many people looking after their loved ones it is an expression of just that: love. But our carers do deserve a lot more care. When the next government grapples with the crisis in the NHS, it will have to think about the care sector, and as part of that it should think about how to support unpaid carers. That means more money to social care, and funding local health and social services to do more for families in the home. It also means leaning on employers. It may be easier for an accountant, say, to negotiate more flexibility at work so that they can care for a parent; but companies that provide precarious contracts and low pay also need to step up to the mark. Let us hope that Ms Garraway\u2019s films spark a national conversation and serious change. Society is nothing without care, and we would be nowhere without our invisible army of carers."},
{"headline": "For years, I saw sex as a competitive sport. Then I realised how empty I felt", "author": "Cornelia Holzbauer", "teaser": "I am still a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community, but I am happier since giving up casual encounters", "published": "Mon 4 Mar 2024 10.00 CET", "content": "Until recently, I used sexual encounters the same way others might a glass of wine after a long day, or some chocolate after a meal \u2013 before you know it, one glass can quickly turn into two or three, or a chocolate bar a day.\nHaving been single for almost five years, I found myself increasingly viewing sex as a competitive sport. It became a means to an end \u2013 an orgasm, a stress relief, a cure for boredom or loneliness. One time, I joked with my friends that I \u201cmasturbated with his body\u201d, referring to my latest conquest.\nI had been keenly aware of my casual approach towards sex for a while, but I didn\u2019t see it as a problem \u2013 I was never addicted to sex and had long been a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community. I lived by the mantra: \u201cSingles deserve intimacy, too.\u201d\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s clear that I was confusing sex with intimacy. I thought: \u201cJust because I am not in a relationship, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get to have all the sex my heart desires.\u201d But what started as an empowered \u201cI am different, I wear my nymphomania as a badge of honour\u201d journey soon snowballed into saying \u201cyes\u201d when I should have really said \u201cno\u201d.\nLast summer, I slept with a man with whom I had a rare, electric chemistry. But at 7am, after about four hours of sleep, he woke me rudely and asked me to leave \u2013 he told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep\u201d while I was there. I gathered my stuff and left, after asking him to book me an Uber. Five minutes into the ride, the driver informed me it had been cancelled. When I called the man to ask what had happened, he said I \u201chad been cold to him\u201d upon my departure. My jaw fell to the floor as I found myself stranded somewhere in Upper Manhattan.\nLast autumn, I met a man via a dating app and slept with him on the first date. After we were done \u2013 it was already 3am \u2013 he declared that he\u2019d have to go home now. Taken aback, I inquired why he wouldn\u2019t just stay over and leave in the morning. His response: \u201cSleeping next to a woman is too intimate. I\u2019d risk her falling in love with me.\u201d\nI can think of at least 10 more similar situations where I felt belittled, sidelined, slut-shamed or all of the above. But what haunts me the most is that I know I have done the same to some of my sexual partners in the past. My numbness led me to believe that this was normal behaviour in the jungle that is otherwise known as casual sex among singles.\nMy unhealthy relationship with sex came to an unceremonious end with the help of social media and a good cry. In November, inspired by the social media trend \u201cDating Wrapped\u201d, where singles post slideshow presentations summing up their year of dating, I counted the number of people I had bedded in the last year \u2013 20. I was shocked by the relatively high number, considering almost none of them had made me feel fulfilled, excited or empowered.\nMany of those encounters had been so forgettable that I had trouble recalling how I felt during or after, or found myself zoning out and thinking of something else while doing the deed. I had sometimes said \u201cyes\u201d to sleeping with someone simply because they asked, even if I wasn\u2019t attracted to them.\nLooking back, there was no one big lightbulb moment that led me to quitting casual encounters. (That might not have worked anyway; going cold turkey after years of bingeing may lead to relapses.) But sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner table surrounded by my happily married parents and my sister, her fiance and toddler, I found myself sobbing uncontrollably. The juxtaposition between my life and theirs suddenly dawned on me: \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time someone I liked held my hand or hugged me.\u201d\nI knew I needed to stop having sex with anybody other than myself \u2013 a realisation born out of pure exhaustion. I now have one rule for my current existence: I won\u2019t sleep with anyone for whom I don\u2019t have romantic feelings. It\u2019s been almost four months since I had a sexual encounter (what I used to call a \u201cdry spell\u201d), and I am feeling cleansed. The \u201csugar\u201d and \u201ctoxins\u201d are leaving my body \u2013 or rather, my mind \u2013 and I am clear and focused. It\u2019s a whole new world for me, and I feel excited, dedicating the time I used to spend recruiting my next lead, and later crying to my therapist, on my career instead.\nOf course, there are withdrawal symptoms. They usually kick in when I encounter a sex scene in a TV show or movie, or when I witness a friend going home with someone after a night out. But I am starting to realise that sex is not a numbers game and that intimacy and sex can be entirely different things.\nWhile my body is closed for business, my heart is open for romance.\nCornelia Holzbauer is a health and wellness journalist based in New York City\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But don\u2019t expect much more", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 20.26 CET", "content": "The extent of the Biden administration\u2019s shift at the United Nations security council on Monday should not be underestimated. The US is not only by far Israel\u2019s most important ally and supplier of aid, but has provided it with stalwart diplomatic support. That it abstained instead of vetoing a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire \u2013 as it had previously done \u2013 was a major departure and leaves Israel looking extremely isolated, as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s angry reaction showed.\nYet the US has since done its best to talk down its decision, with officials insisting that there has been no change in policy and describing the resolution as non-binding. That is not the view of other security council members or the UN itself. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote that it would be \u201cunforgivable\u201d to fail to implement the resolution, which also called for the unconditional release of hostages. But Israeli airstrikes have continued.\nThe Biden administration is well aware that this war is ravaging its international standing: it is judged both complicit in the suffering in Gaza and ineffectual in its ability to restrain Israel\u2019s conduct of the war. At home, it is costing the president vital Democratic support in an election year. But more Americans believe that Israel\u2019s conduct of the war is acceptable than unacceptable, although there is a clear \u2013 and generational \u2013 divide.\nMike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, has already said that he will invite Mr Netanyahu to speak before Congress. Though many in Israel fully understand the long-term damage the Israeli prime minister has done to his country\u2019s interests as he fights for his own, there is no sign that US exasperation will speed his departure or moderate the conduct of this war.\nWhile the Biden administration treads gingerly, the humanitarian catastrophe gallops ahead in Gaza. The UN resolution stipulates a ceasefire for Ramadan \u2013 already half passed. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza\u2019s health authorities. Disease and starvation are claiming more lives as the most intense famine since the second world war takes hold \u2013 a famine entirely human-made by the destruction of so much of Gaza and the reduction of aid to a trickle. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees central to relief efforts, has said that Israel has banned it from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza.\nMr Biden has described the placing of conditions on US military aid as a \u201cworthwhile thought\u201d, but it does not appear to be one that he intends to translate into reality, though past administrations have threatened or imposed them. Recipients of arms must now give assurances that they abide by international law, but the US says it has \u201cno evidence\u201d that Israel is not in compliance. Many Democrats disagree.\nCanada has already announced that it is suspending further sales. The UK shifted from abstaining to supporting the ceasefire resolution on Monday, and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has urged the Foreign Office to publish its formal legal advice on whether Israel is breaching international law in Gaza. The reality is, however, that 99% of Israel\u2019s arms imports come from the US and Germany. Hand-wringing over humanitarian suffering is pointless when you continue to supply the weapons creating the disaster. Monday\u2019s abstention was an important symbolic moment, but it appears that little will alter unless the US makes a substantive change.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Interveners can put a case without being among the main parties to the litigation.\nFor Women Scotland is challenging whether Scottish government legislation aimed at improving gender balance on public boards should include transgender women.\nThe Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018 has been the subject of a long-running court action by the group, which most recently resulted in a ruling by Lady Haldane at the court of session that it was lawful to extend the definition of \u201cwoman\u201d to transgender women with a gender recognition certificate.\nMcCloud, who transitioned in the late 1990s and subsequently changed her legal sex under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, is supported in her application by the Good Law Project.\nShe is concerned about the effect of a successful appeal \u2013 which would affect the whole of the UK \u2013 on her legal recognition.\nMcCloud cannot speak directly to the media because of judicial constraints. A friend of hers said: \u201cThis would mean in practice that women like her [with a gender recognition certificate] would lose rights to equal pay with men and experience restricted rights to services or moves to exclude her from spaces such as women\u2019s lavatories.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands that if the For Women Scotland appeal succeeds, McCloud and her family have made provision to emigrate to an EU state where she would remain legally recognised as a woman.\nLast month McCloud, 54, announced that she was resigning from the bench in April after 14 years as a full-time judge, citing the toxic climate towards transgender individuals in the UK.\nIn her resignation letter to the lady chief justice, president and vice-president of the king\u2019s bench division, she wrote: \u201cI have reached the conclusion that in 2024 the national situation and present judicial framework is no longer such that it is possible in a dignified way to be both \u2018trans\u2019 and a salaried, fairly prominent judge in the UK.\u201d\nAccording to For Women Scotland, which won an earlier judicial review of the act, the conflicting Scottish rulings \u201cshow that a definition of \u2018sex\u2019 that is inclusive of a person\u2019s \u2018acquired gender\u2019 on a gender recognition certificate leaves the Equality Act opaque and unworkable for many women. There needs to be clarity that sex is a biological term.\u201d\nIt argues that Haldane\u2019s inclusive definition of \u201csex\u201d leaves service providers of single-sex spaces \u201cconfused and \u2026 at risk of legal action for unlawful discrimination\u201d.\nDescribing the case as \u201ctruly historic\u201d, the author and campaigner JK Rowling has donated \u00a370,000 to For Women Scotland\u2019s crowdfunder for the action, which currently sits at nearly \u00a3150,000.\nThe executive director of the Good Law Project, Jo Maugham, said: \u201cSo many of these cases \u2013 about and with profound effects on the lives of trans people \u2013 are decided without any trans people in the room. Sometimes this happens because trans people can\u2019t afford representation \u2013 they have no billionaire funders.\n\u201cSometimes because it is said that trans people are self-interested \u2013 as though decisions about, say, black people should be made by white people.

{"headline": "Euro 2024 power rankings: a look at the 24 teams going to Germany", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 09.00 CET", "content": "This was not a vintage window for Didier Deschamps\u2019 side with a home defeat against Germany followed up by a shaky 3-2 win against Chile in Marseille. The captain, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, had a difficult few days and the absence of Antoine Griezmann, who missed his first France games for seven years because of injury, was clearly felt. There were positives, however, with the 18-year-old Warren Za\u00efre-Emery having a good game against Germany and Randal Kolo Muani scoring and assisting against Chile. Deschamps made nine changes for the second game with William Saliba getting a rare start in Marseille, even though the coach had said beforehand that the Arsenal player \u201cdoes things he doesn\u2019t like\u201d. Still the team to beat. Marcus Christenson\nThe results in these friendlies will not matter come the start of the Euros yet England\u2019s celebrations after Jude Bellingham\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser against Belgium on Tuesday night showed they did not want another defeat. \u201cWe knew the rubbish we would get,\u201d said the goalscorer. Having lost to Brazil on Saturday, there was a much-improved performance against the Red Devils with the 18-year-old midfielder Kobbie Mainoo the standout performer. The two games, though, showed that Gareth Southgate will need Harry Kane fit in Germany to be able to threaten the best. MC\nCrisis, what crisis? The Euro 2024 hosts, who looked in disarray only four months ago, will approach the tournament with an almighty spring in their step following victories against France (away) and the Netherlands (home). The 2-0 win in Lyon was particularly impressive, Florian Wirtz scoring a wonderful goal after seven seconds, as the winning margin could have been even bigger. Toni Kroos was back dictating things in central midfield, where Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Robert Andrich impressed next to the Real Madrid veteran. Julian Nagelsmann made no changes between the two games, which meant two starts for Stuttgart\u2019s 27-year-old left-back Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt, who was on the bench for Hertha Berlin as they were relegated last season but now looks like a certain starter for the Euros. MC\n\u201cA game against Brazil is never a friendly,\u201d Dani Olmo said after the tempestuous 3-3 draw at the Bernab\u00e9u on Tuesday night, a game that had it all: great goals, feisty challenges and calamitous mistakes. Tempers threatened to boil over after Brazil\u2019s late equaliser and subsequent celebrations and the Spain coach, Luis de la Fuente, was dismayed that a section of the crowd had booed the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker \u00c1lvaro Morata. Spain were superb in the first half and would likely have run away with the game but for an Unai Sim\u00f3n mistake after 40 minutes with Spain 2-0 up. The 16-year-old Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal was outstanding on the right wing and looks set to be one of the most exciting players at this summer\u2019s Euros. The fireworks at the Bernab\u00e9u made up for the disappointing performance in the 1-0 defeat against Colombia in London on Friday and, as De la Fuente said: \u201cWe learn more from defeats than from victories.\u201d MC\nAnd so, in the 12th game of Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s Portugal reign came the first defeat. After an immaculate qualifying campaign, with 10 wins in 10 games and a goal difference of +34, as well as an impressive 5-2 win against Sweden on Thursday, Portugal slumped to a 2-0 defeat in Slovenia after a lacklustre performance. It should act as a wake-up call but no need to press any panic buttons yet. The game did, however, provide more evidence, if needed, of the importance of Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva, both of whom did not play in Ljubljana. \u201cThe objective of these fixtures was not to win,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez before adding \u201calthough we never like to lose\u201d. The Spaniard called up more than 30 players for the two games and gave most of them a chance. Nuno Travassos\nGames against Scotland and Germany produced a mixed bag of results, performances and even formations for Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. They beat the Scots 4-0 in Amsterdam having being lined up by Koeman in a 4-3-3 formation, and while the scoreline may suggest it was a cakewalk for the Oranje it was visitors who largely dominated proceedings, creating a host of chances but failing to take any and subsequently being punished by three Dutch goals in the last 18 minutes of the game, scored by Georginio Wijnaldum, Wout Weghorst and Donyell Malen, following Tijjani Reijnders\u2019 strike five minutes before half-time. It was an impressive show of ruthlessness by the Dutch that was again on show four minutes into Tuesday\u2019s game against Germany when Joey Veerman gave the visitors the lead in Frankfurt with a well-taken volley. The Netherlands, back in a more usual 3-5-2 formation, continued to threaten on the counterattack but failed to score again while allowing Germany to do so twice, through Mittelst\u00e4dt and Niclas F\u00fcllkrug. Koeman\u2019s side look dangerous but will need tightening up defensively if they are to make progress once back in Germany this summer. Sachin Nakrani\nBelgium ended the international window unbeaten in 12 games under their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, but that was largely where the encouragement started and ended. The world\u2019s fourth-best team looked anything but in a goalless draw with Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Saturday, a game that could well have ended in defeat had Evan Ferguson not missed an early penalty for the hosts, and while a stronger lineup were better against England on Tuesday, they were also pretty lucky to escape Wembley with a 2-2 draw, with Tedesco admitting afterwards that he could not bemoan Jude Bellingham\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser given how much the hosts had dominated the play. Belgium enjoyed only 37% possession and only scored twice through Youri Tielemans because of defensive errors by their opponents. Kevin De Bruyne is to come back into the team but, in general, the Red Devils don\u2019t appear to be serious contenders for the ultimate prize in Germany this summer. SN\nLuciano Spalletti took his squad to the United States for two games, against Ecuador and Venezuela, and returned home with two wins, four goals scored and one clean sheet. It was not pretty at times but Gli Azzurri set the tone with their pressing as well as work ethic and Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Lorenzo Pellegrini showed again that they are at the top of their game. Genoa\u2019s Mateo Retegui scored twice against Venezuela to confirm his status as the first-choice No 9 (although the options in that position are so few that it is one of Spalletti\u2019s major concerns going into the Euros). \u201cA very positive tour,\u201d said a pleased Spalletti, \u201cvery well organised by the federation and the team played two good games.\u201d MC\nAfter 174 caps and 18 years with the national team Luka Modric finally lifted an international trophy. It may have been \u201conly\u201d the ACUD Cup \u2013 a friendly tournament organised in Cairo \u2013 but the image was striking nevertheless. Croatia played two very different games. The semi-final against Tunisia was a tedious affair in front of around 1,000 people that went to penalties after few real chances, but the final, against the hosts, who were without Mohamed Salah, saw an attendance of 83,350 at the Misr Stadium. The Vatreni looked much better in the latter, switching to a 4-2-3-1 formation from their usual 4-3-3 and exploring some other back-up options such as Josko Gvardiol at left-back (rather than centre-back) to win 4-2. Aleksandar Holiga\nIt is fair to say that Ralf Rangnick\u2019s side were not slow off the blocks this fortnight and they followed up Christoph Baumgartner\u2019s world-record (for internationals) goal after six seconds against Slovakia by taking the lead against Turkey after 103 seconds. Despite missing key players such as David Alaba, Marko Arnautovic and Marcel Sabitzer, who fell ill before the game, they went on to win 6-1, playing carefree, attacking football in front of 38,000 fans at the Ernst-Happel Stadium. It was a fifth consecutive win for Austria and Michael Gregoritsch got a hat-trick. \u201cThe second half was close to perfection,\u201d beamed Rangnick. Andreas Hagenauer\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am more positive or negative to our chances at the Euros after these two games,\u201d said an honest Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg after Denmark had drawn 0-0 against Switzerland and beaten the Faroe Islands 2-0. The coach, Kasper Hjulmand, tried different systems and players in the two games but has come in for some rare criticism recently. The fact that Christian Eriksen made the squad despite lack of playing time at Manchester United was highlighted as a sign of weakness and the former Denmark international Thomas Gravesen even wondered whether Hjulmand was still the right person for the job. \u201cIf someone really thinks that I don\u2019t pick the best player I think we have to win games \u2026 well, it is my backside on the line here too,\u201d Hjulmand responded. MC\nTwo wins from two during this international break is a real positive for Hungary, with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Turkey on Friday followed by a workmanlike 2-0 victory over Kosovo on Tuesday. Marco Rossi\u2019s much-changed side looked out of sorts in the first 45 minutes of the most recent contest and could easily have fallen behind, but three changes at half-time lit a fire under the hosts and the intensity that has come to define this team re-emerged. Right now, only Colombia have a longer unbeaten run in international football than Hungary, who haven\u2019t lost since Dominik Szoboszlai took over as captain. Instrumental again on Tuesday, the Liverpool midfielder has five goals and two assists in his last five international appearances and will be at the heart of everything Hungary aim to achieve this summer. Tom Mortimer\n\u201cThe stats don\u2019t lie,\u201d Xherdan Shaqiri said after starting on the bench for Switzerland in the 0-0 draw against Denmark. Four days later he was back in the starting XI and scored the only goal of the game against Ireland in the 1-0 win in Dublin. It was not only the goal, coming from a free-kick, that made the difference. The 32-year-old also introduced some unpredictability to the Swiss side, something that was missing against Denmark. In the end, the coach, Murat Yakin, could be fairly pleased with the team. Vincent Sierro and Dereck Kutesa made their debuts against Ireland and did not look out of place while Dan Ndoye impressed on his ninth cap. It was a welcome success for Yakin after five winless games, a run stretching back to last September. MC\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nRomania drew 1-1 with Northern Ireland and lost 3-2 Colombia during the international break. Both performances were largely average in quality, highlighting the team\u2019s weaknesses in defence and shortage of ideas in attack. Saying that, there were moments against Colombia where Romania showed flashes of old and, in that regard, it was fitting that Ianis Hagi, son of the great Gheorghe, scored having come on as a substitute. Overall, however, there is much for Edward Iordanescu\u2019s side to improve upon before they compete at Euro 2024. Emanuel Rosu\nWhat a week it has been for Poland, with two playoff wins, against Estonia and Wales, securing their place at this summer\u2019s European Championships. Each game showed different strengths of Michal Probierz\u2019s men; ruthlessness and domination in the 5-1 thrashing of Estonia in Warsaw last Thursday followed by determination and togetherness in the penalty shootout victory over Wales in Cardiff on Tuesday. The latter triumph was far from pretty \u2013 Poland did not record a shot on target until the shootout \u2013 but it also showed how far they have come after their poor group campaign under Fernando Santos. They were a collection of individuals then; now they are a team and for Robert Lewandowski comes the chance to play at what will probably be the striker\u2019s last ever major tournament. Maciej Slominski\nThere was some consternation in Serbia from people who saw this international window as a missed opportunity, that the fixture against Russia was politically motivated rather than giving Dragan Stojkovic the best chance to fine-tune his Euro plans. They lost 4-0 in Moscow after an early red card for the defender Milan Gajic, one of three players in the starting XI who ply their trade in the Russian Premier League. They then beat Cyprus 1-0 after an early Sergej Milinkovic-Savic goal but they were not at their fluent best. MC\nA pair of two 2-1 wins, away to Norway on Friday and home to Armenia on Tuesday, made this an encouraging international window for Ivan Hasek\u2019s side. It is now five games without defeat for Czech Republic with Hasek overseeing a 100% record in charge having returned to the post of head coach in January. The former Czechoslovakia captain previously led the national team for a brief spell in 2009 and will feel his team can make a mark in Germany this summer given they\u2019re in a group with Portugal, Turkey and Georgia and have a squad that contains the likes of Tomas Soucek and Patrik Schick, both of whom featured in their two most recent victories. SN\nSteve Clarke denied he is concerned about his team\u2019s form and prospects following their 4-0 trouncing by the Netherlands in Amsterdam on Friday and subsequent 1-0 loss to Northern Ireland at Hampden Park on Tuesday but he really should be. Scotland have now lost five and drawn two of their past seven matches and, overall, look shaky at the back and toothless in attack. Against Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s men they were especially lacking in imagination, which is a concern given there are only the June friendlies against Gibraltar and Finland to come in regards to rediscovering a bounce before taking on Germany in Munich in the opening game of the summer tournament. Jamie Jackson\n\u201cThis win feels phenomenal,\u201d said the assistant coach, Bostjan Cesar, after Slovenia had defeated Portugal 2-0 at the Stozice Stadium. Cesar, who stepped in after head coach Matjaz Kek\u2019s father died last week, added that they had learned their lessons from the disappointing draw against Malta five days earlier. Against Portugal everyone stepped up, from the composed Jan Oblak in goal, to an organised defence and an energy-filled attack, led superbly by Benjamin Sesko, and they deserved the win, keeping Cristiano Ronaldo and co at arm\u2019s length. The visitors had chances but Slovenia took theirs, Adam Gnezda Cerin and Timi Max Elsnik getting the second-half goals. There was praise after the game from the Portugal manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who backed Slovenia to cause problems for Group C opponents England, Serbia and Denmark at the Euros. Miran Zore\nTurkey were close to heading into Euro 2024 as dark horses after topping their qualification group, but back-to-back defeats \u2013 including a humiliating 6-1 defeat to Austria \u2013 has raised questions about Vincenzo Montella\u2019s side. In fairness they delivered a pretty good display against Hungary in Budapest on Friday and were somewhat unlucky to lose 1-0, but their inability to turn chances into goals was glaring. Bournemouth\u2019s Enes Unal performed poorly as the lone striker in a 4-2-3-1 formation and the worry is Montella does not have many alternatives. Things got much worse for Turkey at the Ernst Happel Stadium on Tuesday, with Austria dominating proceedings from start to finish, and it was somewhat telling that Turkey\u2019s goal, scored by Hakan Calhanoglu, came from the penalty spot. These defeats will come as a blow to Montella, who was asked if he would resign after the Austria game, but he has time, at least, to resolve Turkey\u2019s weaknesses between now and the summer. Emre Sarigul\nQuite apart from the geopolitical significance of their victory over Iceland on Tuesday night \u2013 and frankly, who doesn\u2019t love a little schadenfreude at the expense of Vladimir Putin? \u2013 on a purely sporting level it would have been a crashing shame if the Euros had been deprived of this richly talented Ukraine side, stuffed with promise all over the pitch. Not one but two world-class goalkeepers in Andriy Lunin and Anatoliy Trubin; the brilliant young playmaker Georgiy Sudakov; more familiar faces in Oleksandr Zinchenko and Mykhailo Mudryk, whose winning goal could be a formative moment in a still-developing international career. Sergiy Rebrov has proven a shrewd appointment as coach and if he can iron out some of this team\u2019s inconsistencies, they could do some real damage this summer. Jonathan Liew\nIt\u2019s been a difficult international window for Slovakia\u2019s head coach, Francesco Calzona. In games against Austria and Norway, he had to improvise given the absence of key players due to injury, most notably captain Milan Skriniar. The absences gave fringe players the opportunity to shine but they certainly did not do that in Friday\u2019s 2-0 loss to Austria. The performance in the 1-1 draw away to Norway on Tuesday was much improved, however. Calzona, who is combining his duties as Slovakia coach with being caretaker manager of Napoli until the end of the season, has much work to do but can at least take heart from the displays of the young centre-back Adam Obert, who impressed in both games. Lukas Vrablik\nAlbania, who topped qualifying Group E ahead of the Czech Republic and Poland, suffered two defeats, with the 3-0 reverse to Chile in Italy particularly painful. However, the head coach, Sylvinho, tried to put a positive spin on the performance. \u201cWe did create a lot of chances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe created six or seven decent chances and that is not bad against a team such as Chile. However, in the Euros we may get two or three good chances in a game \u2013 and then we have to take them.\u201d Against Sweden in Stockholm, with a large Albanian contingent in attendance, they were much better, losing narrowly 1-0 but should have had a penalty when Armando Broja was brought down in the first half. \u201cI have nothing negative to say about the players today,\u201d Sylvinho said. There is work to be done, however, if Albania are going to cause some upsets in two months\u2019 time. MC\nWilly Sagnol\u2019s side had to win two home games to reach the Euros and they did, just. Luxembourg, who had a player sent off in the semi-final, were beaten 2-0 while the final against Greece went to penalties. It was an ill-tempered game at times in front of a fanatical home support with tensions boiling over when the half-time whistle blew and a red card shown to a member of each coaching staff. When it was all done and dusted though Georgia had made history by qualifying for their first ever major tournament. \u201cSome did not believe in us but now they will believe it. We are happy. I have never had such an emotion in my life,\u201d Khvicha Kvaratskhelia told 1TV Sport. \u201cThanks to the Georgian fans. I\u2019ve played in many stadiums but I haven\u2019t seen such support anywhere. You were the most important factor.\u201d MC"},
{"headline": "\u2018We\u2019d like to shoot them all\u2019: growing army of wolfdogs raises hackles across Europe", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "From the moment the rangers first saw him on their trail cameras, the problem was apparent. The wolf, spotted deep in the woods of Italy\u2019s Gran Bosco di Salbertrand park, was not grey like his companion, but an unusual blond. His colouring indicated this was not a wolf at all, but a hybrid wolfdog \u2013 the first to be seen so far into Piedmont\u2019s alpine region. And where one hybrid is found, more are sure to follow.\n\u201cWe thought he would go away,\u201d says Elisa Ramassa, a park ranger in Gran Bosco who has tracked the local wolves for 25 years. \u201cUnfortunately, he found a female who loves blonds.\u201d\nThe blond specimen spotted in Piedmont illustrates the latest development in a worrying new trend. Over the past two decades, Europe\u2019s decimated wolf population has slowly been resurrected through years of painstaking conservation work. Now hybrid numbers are rapidly growing \u2013 and if their spread continues, scientists fear they may put the European wolf \u2013 as a wild, genetically distinct animal \u2013 at risk of extinction.\nElisa Ramassa and fellow ranger Massimo Rosso search for wolf tracks in Gran Bosco di Salbertrand park\nIn Piedmont, the blond hybrid produced at least two sets of pups before disappearing. \u201cFrom one event, we now have several packs with hybrids,\u201d says Luca Anselmo, a wolf tracker and researcher with Life WolfAlps EU, a multi-year, multimillion dollar initiative to support the return of wolves to Europe and reduce their conflicts with humans.\nStudies point to the presence of hybrid wolfdogs, such as the one pictured, in nearly every European country with wolves\nHybrid wolfdogs are not a new phenomenon. While present-day wolves and dogs are distinct sub-species, they belong to the same canine family, and have retained genetic overlap since humans began domesticating ancient wolf ancestors thousands of years ago. Modern wolfdog hybrids had not been well-studied until recently, however, when advances in genetics made it possible to prove their existence. When Luigi Boitani, Italy\u2019s leading wolf expert, captured a hybrid in 1975, he says he \u201cwas met with everything from gentle opposition to [people who] said, \u2018this is bullshit\u2019.\u201d\nTime has proven Boitani right. Today, a growing number of studies point to the presence of hybrids in nearly every European country with wolves, and in some areas their numbers are growing steadily. In Boitani\u2019s native Tuscany, and other regions, they have become endemic, accounting for as much as 70% of the wolf population. The rise has been driven by the increasing destruction of wolf habitats and the expansion of human settlements, which bring people, their pets, and packs of stray dogs into more frequent contact with wolf packs.\nIn some regions \u201cthey are basically all hybrids,\u201d Boitani says. \u201cIn this case, there is nothing you can do. You cannot send the army and kill everything.\u201d\nHybrids trouble conservationists partly for their unpredictability. They may increase conflict with humans, crowd pure-blood wolves out of their habitat, or reduce the viability of future offspring.\nAnticlockwise from top: rangers search Gran Bosco di Salbertrand park for signs of wolves; camera traps are used to learn more about their behaviour; Luca Anselmo (left), a wolf researcher and tracker\nSome fear that interbreeding will result in the permanent loss of the wolf\u2019s distinct attributes. \u201cIf tomorrow I see an animal that is black and white, with floppy ears and a long tail, and you tell me it is a wolf, I [would be] disappointed,\u201d Boitani says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see wolves in that way.\u201d\nFor many conservationists, such hybrids represent the growing imprint of humankind on a revered wild species. Frequently, they are the result of neglected working dogs mingling with isolated wolves, whose packs may have been disrupted by culls or poaching. In the words of Ramassa, the park ranger, they are \u201ca human mistake\u201d.\n\u201cWe are speeding up a process that might have occurred naturally,\u201d says Valeria Salvatori, a wolf expert who led the first Europe-wide study into hybridisation. \u201cIt\u2019s like global warming \u2026 we do have a duty to mitigate such an impact.\u201d\nFrancesca Marucco, scientific coordinator for Life WolfAlps EU, has studied wolves for more than 20 years\nBut there is considerable disagreement about what that mitigation should look like. Some experts, like Francesca Marucco, the scientific coordinator for Life WolfAlps EU, take a harder line. \u201cWe\u2019d like to shoot \u2026 all [the hybrids] as soon as possible,\u201d she says.\nThis approach is being taken by authorities including Austria, Switzerland, Poland and Slovenia. A female wolf who reproduced with a dog in Slovenia was recently culled alongside all her offspring \u2013 save one, who made it over the border to Italy. Animal rights groups in Italy have vocally opposed culling, and hybrids are more likely to be left alive long enough to breed.\nThere is disagreement over whether hybrids should be allowed to breed or be culled\nWith such a long history of interbreeding between species, however, some conservationists question an aggressive approach. In Poland, researchers are leading investigations into the potential advantages of hybridisation. In Yellowstone national park in the US, for example, hybrid wolves were found to have higher resistance to certain diseases.\nWolfdog hybrids may also be better adapted to survive in a world where wolves are increasingly forced to live in urban environments. \u201cIn the modern, human-dominated world, maybe it is useful for the wolves to have some dog-like behaviour in them,\u201d says Miha Krofel, a Slovenian researcher. \u201cI think the costs outweigh the benefits \u2026 [but] we don\u2019t really have an understanding of how problematic hybrids are for the human-wolf conflict.\u201d\nTop: data from a tracking collar provides insights into the wolves\u2019 behaviour. Below: wolf droppings are collected for analysis\nOthers are pushing to better understand how hybrids behave in the wild, and whether they occupy wolves\u2019 ecological niche. When Anselmo\u2019s team learned of the hybrid pack in Piedmont, they set out not to kill, but capture and sterilise them. For 25 days, Anselmo and his team pursued one hybrid, who they called Godot, along the mountain slopes, observing stringent Italian welfare laws that require them to stay within 30 minutes\u2019 distance from the trap.\nAt last, Godot was captured, neutered and collared, along with one of his siblings. The data from his collar has so far shown that the hybrid pack behaves much like any other, and appears to suffer no discrimination from their full-blooded peers.\n\u201cWe feared that he would behave more like a dog \u2013 he would look for humans, or go near houses, looking for food,\u201d says Ramassa. \u201cBut no, he\u2019s like a wolf.\u201d\nUltimately, however, Anselmo admits that catch-and-release is not a practical solution at scale. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cTrapping wolves is the most difficult thing I have done in my life.\u201d\nAddressing the conservation risk that wolfdogs pose will require some consensus among scientists \u2013 and wider society \u2013 about how to respond.\n\u201cThey need to have the courage and decide: what do we want to preserve?\u201d says Salvatori. \u201cDo we want to preserve wolves?

{"headline": "Nick Cave on love, art and the loss of his sons: \u2018It\u2019s against nature to bury your children\u2019", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 06.00 CET", "content": "Nick Cave has a touch of Dr Frankenstein about him \u2013 long, white lab coat, inscrutable smile, unnerving intensity. He introduces me to his two assistants, the identical twins Liv and Dom Cave-Sutherland, who are helping to glaze his ceramics series, The Devil \u2013 A Life. The twins are not related to Cave. His wife, the fashion designer Susie Cave, came across them one day, discovered they were ceramicists and thought they would be able to help him complete his project. It adds to the eeriness of it all.\nCave, 66, is one of the world\u2019s great singer-songwriters \u2013 from the howling post-punk of the Birthday Party and the Bad Seeds to the lugubrious lyricism of his love songs (Into My Arms, Straight to You and a million others I adore) and the haunted grief of recent albums such as Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen and Carnage. He is also a fine author (see his apocalyptic novel And the Ass Saw the Angel), thinker (his book of conversations with the Observer journalist Sean O\u2019Hagan, Faith, Hope and Carnage), agony uncle (at his website, the Red Hand Files), screenwriter (The Proposition) and now visual artist. Which is where he started out half a century ago.\nCave studied art in Melbourne in the mid-70s before being chucked off his degree course. He reckons he was too fascinated by the subject for his own good. He spent all his time talking about art to the older students and didn\u2019t find the hours to do the actual work. Now, he is making up for lost time.\n\u2018These losses are incorporated into the artistic flow\u2019 \u2026 Cave\u2019s sculptures go through the glazing process. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nWe are at the headquarters of Susie\u2019s business, where she makes and stores the beautiful dresses she designs as The Vampire\u2019s Wife. For now, it\u2019s doubling as Cave\u2019s studio. He gives me a tour of the 17 ceramic figurines, which will be exhibited at Xavier Hufkens in Brussels next month. The pieces are stunning in a creepy, Cave-esque way, all blood-curdling pastoral idylls. But it\u2019s as a series that they are most powerful. The sculptures, inspired by Staffordshire \u201cflatback\u201d ceramics from the Victorian era, forge a shocking and deeply personal narrative.\nInitially, we see the devil as a child \u2013 a cute little lad, dimple-cheeked in a white jumpsuit sitting next to a red monkey. \u201cLook at his little face,\u201d Cave says, lovingly. We see the devil getting up to erotic mischief with a sailor, then ecstatic with his first love. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with this one,\u201d Cave says. \u201cHis impish pleasure and her just drained of life.\u201d\nWe see the devil going to war in a field of flowers, wading through a field of blood and skulls on his return, getting married. Then the series takes a traumatic turn. \u201cThis is The Devil Kills His First Child,\u201d Cave says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little Isaac and Abraham thing. Then he\u2019s separated from the world. Life goes on. Then he dances for the last time.\u201d And now we are at the final piece. \u201cHe bleeds to death. He\u2019s found washed up and the child is forgiving him, leaning out to him with his hand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how to respond when Cave reaches the story\u2019s conclusion other than to gulp or weep. After all, this is a man who has lost two sons over the past nine years. In 2015, 15-year-old Arthur died after taking LSD for the first time and falling from a cliff near his home in Brighton. In 2022, 31-year-old Jethro, who had schizophrenia, died in Melbourne. Death and grief have informed all of Cave\u2019s work since Arthur died. But this takes it to another level.\n\u2018The child is forgiving him\u2019 \u2026 Devil Bleeds to Death, the final piece in the collection. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nWe say goodbye to the Cave twins, who continue painting pubic hair in gold lustre on the devil\u2019s first love. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you, guys! Slave away, my children!\u201d Cave says.\nLiv smiles.\n\u201cI\u2019m already dressed like a Victorian child\u2019,\u201d Dom says.\n\u201cA pint of stout for lunch!\u201d Cave says.\nWe move into Susie\u2019s office to chat. It\u2019s dark, gothic, a dream home for bats. He whips off his lab coat to reveal an immaculate three-piece suit and sits behind the desk. Before I sit down, I ask if I can do something I have wanted to do for the best part of a decade. I reach over the desk and clumsily hug him.\n\u201cAaah, man! Here, let me stand up.\u201d The last time we talked was 16 years ago. He was making a video that featured Arthur and his twin brother, Earl, who were then seven, gorgeous and already musical (Arthur was playing drums, Earl guitar).\nCave became famous as one of the bad boys of rock \u2013 a ghoulish junkie with a feral live act, equally fixated by the Bible and Beelzebub. But he is one of the nicest people I have met. In 2008, I turned up knowing sod all about him. I tell him that he was so generous with his time and nonjudgmental about my ignorance. \u201cReally?\u201d he says, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I tend to have a low opinion of myself back then. I see a cutoff point around the death of my first son of a change of character. But it\u2019s not as black and white as I thought.\u201d\nIn the studio. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nEvery Cave story seems to begin with a death. Take the origin of the figurines. He went into the studio to start work on them the day his mother, Dawn, died. He had planned to start on that date \u2013 15 September 2020 \u2013 for a while. \u201cSusie made me go. She said: \u2018Get there and do your work.\u2019\u201d He adored Dawn \u2013 she had always stood by him, no matter what trouble he was in. (The day his father died in a car crash, she was called to the police station to bail out 19-year-old Cave after he had been charged with burglary.)\nDid he have any idea what he wanted to create in the studio? No, he says, but there was an inevitability about the subject. \u201cEven when I\u2019m trying to use art to escape certain feelings and sorrows I have, everything just seems to fall into the slipstream of the loss of my son. And even when I was glazing these, Jethro died, so it\u2019s like \u2026\u201d He comes to a stop. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is these losses are just incorporated into the artistic flow and they move in a direction that is beyond your capacity to rein in. They\u2019re just sitting at the end of everything you do. In the end, the ceramics are a story about a man\u2019s culpability in the loss of his child, and addressing that in a way I wasn\u2019t really able to do with music. That\u2019s what happened without any intention.\u201d\nDoes he feel culpable for the death of his sons? \u201cI think it\u2019s something that people who lose children feel regardless of the situation, simply because the one thing you\u2019re supposed to do is not let your children die.\u201d He comes to another abrupt stop, almost as if he is dictating notes. \u201cForget that. The one thing you\u2019re supposed to do is protect your children.\u201d\nHe returns to the final figurine. \u201cYou have this hollowed-out old man with a little child, possibly a dead old man, dead in a pool of tears \u2013 a biblical flood of tears, shall we say \u2013 and the little child is reaching down in forgiveness. It\u2019s called The Devil Forgiven.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t too abstract, too woo-woo. Art has a way of bringing to you the things you need to know. It feels to me that art knows what\u2019s going on more than the artist knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nDoes he feel culpable because drugs were involved in Arthur\u2019s death? \u201cThere could be some element of that, yep. Look, these things are in our DNA, they\u2019re inherited. I don\u2019t want to make any assumptions about Arthur, who was just a young boy. It\u2019s not like he was into drugs \u2026 On a fundamental level, it\u2019s against nature to be burying your children. And there can\u2019t help but be feelings of culpability.\u201d\nCave believes he is emerging from his losses a different man. He has a point. It is hard to imagine the old Cave curating the Red Hand Files, a website in which he invites fans to ask questions about anything they want, many of them profoundly personal.\nSoon after Arthur\u2019s death, the family moved to Los Angeles for a couple of years: \u201cWe were triggered too much by things. We were just down the road from where it happened.\u201d Everybody seemed to know what had happened to Arthur, because it was so widely reported, but he says that ended up being a positive. \u201cI was forced to grieve publicly \u2013 and that was helpful, weirdly enough. It stopped me completely shutting the windows and bolting the doors and just living in this dark world.\u201d\nHe was overwhelmed by the kindness of strangers. \u201cI had letter after letter addressed to \u2018Nick Cave, Brighton\u2019. It was a really extraordinary thing. And that attention, and sense of community, was extremely helpful to me. I think people are usually just on their own with these sorts of things. Susie met somebody whose son had died seven years previously and she still hadn\u2019t spoken to her husband about it. These people are utterly alone and maybe full of rage. So I can\u2019t overstate that I\u2019ve been in an extraordinarily privileged position in that respect.\u201d\nSusie and Nick Cave at Milan fashion week in 2023. Photograph: Victor Boyko/Getty Images for Gucci\nDid his experience of bereavement help after Jethro died? \u201cYes. It really helped, because I knew I could get through. I\u2019d been through it.\u201d Did he feel cursed? \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t feel cursed, no.\u201d He says it would be wrong to talk publicly about Jethro \u2013 he didn\u2019t meet Jethro till he was seven and their relationship was complex; although they became close, it would be disrespectful to his mother, who brought him up. (Cave\u2019s first two children, Luke and Jethro, were born 10 days apart to different women.)\nCave says one way in which he has changed is that he appreciates life more. In the past, he has described learning to live again, refinding happiness, as an act of defiance. But he no longer thinks it\u2019s an appropriate word. \u201cDefiance has a fuck-you element to the world; we\u2019re not going to let it get us down. That sounds a little too heroic now. I\u2019m pretty simple-minded about things. It says something to my children who have died that I can enjoy my life now. It\u2019s what they would want. I think it\u2019s a softer relationship we have to the world now.\u201d\nRather than a two-fingered salute to fate, it goes back to culpability and his Christian (if questioning) faith. \u201cLook, this is extremely difficult to talk about, but one of the things that used to really worry me is that Arthur, wherever he may be, if he is somewhere, somehow understands what his parents are going through because of something he did, and that his condition of culpability is not dissimilar to mine. And I think that\u2019s the reason behind a lot of what I do. It\u2019s to say it\u2019s OK. I mean it\u2019s not OK, but we\u2019re OK. We\u2019re OK. I think Susie feels that, too.\u201d\nHe stresses that he is not just talking about his personal tragedies. \u201cWhat\u2019s it saying to all those who\u2019ve passed away in their multitudes if we lead lives where we\u2019re just pathologically pissed off at the world? What does it say to those who have left the world to be in a perpetual state of misery and fury and depression and cynicism towards the world? What legacy are they leaving if that\u2019s how we manifest the passing of that person?\u201d\nHe thinks people sometimes misunderstand what he is saying about loss. It\u2019s not that there is more joy in his world than there was \u2013 far from it. But when it comes, it tends to be more intense. \u201cJoy is something that leaps unexpectedly and shockingly out of an understanding of loss and suffering. That\u2019s how Susie and I are. That\u2019s in no way saying we\u2019re not affected, or we\u2019ve somehow gotten over it, or we\u2019ve had closure or even acceptance. I think closure is a dumb thing. Even acceptance is, like: \u2018Just give it a few years and life goes back to how it was.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t happen. You\u2019re fundamentally changed. Your very chemistry is changed. And when you\u2019re put back together again, you\u2019re a different person. The world feels more meaningful.\u201d\nHe knows plenty of people disagree with him. \u201cI get people, mothers particularly, occasionally saying: \u2018How dare you suggest there is joy involved in any of this?\u2019 People are so angry, and they have every right to be enraged by the fucked-up cosmic mischief that goes on, and it\u2019s deeply unfair. But it\u2019s not personal. It feels like it is, but it\u2019s just the vicissitudes of life.\u201d\nAt work. Photograph: courtesy of Liv &amp; Dom\nCave feels he is misunderstood in another way, after saying recently that he has always been \u201ctemperamentally\u201d conservative and attacking the \u201cself-righteous belief\u201d and \u201clack of humility\u201d of woke culture. This has led some to assume he is supping with the \u201calt-right\u201d, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\u201cConservatism is a difficult word to talk about in Britain, because people immediately think of the Tories. But I do think small-C conservatism is someone who has a fundamental understanding of loss, an understanding that to pull something down is easy, to build it back up again is extremely difficult. There is an innate need in us to rip shit down, and I\u2019m personally more cautious in that respect without it being a whole political ideology that surrounds me.\u201d\nIs he a Tory? \u201cI\u2019m not a Tory, no.\u201d Has he ever been? \u201cNo. No, I\u2019ve never voted Tory.\u201d And is he really anti-woke? \u201cThe concept that there are problems with the world we need to address, such as social justice; I\u2019m totally down with that. However, I don\u2019t agree with the methods that are used in order to reach this goal \u2013 shutting down people, cancelling people. There\u2019s a lack of mercy, a lack of forgiveness. These go against what I fundamentally believe on a spiritual level, as much as anything. So it\u2019s a tricky one. The problem with the right taking hold of this word is that it\u2019s made the discussion impossible to have without having to join a whole load of nutjobs who have their problem with it.\u201d\nHe hates dogma, whether religious or political. His work has always embraced uncertainty. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like me to say this, but I do feel it\u2019s in my nature to constantly be redressing the balance of my own ideas about things. My mother was exactly the same \u2013 she always saw the other side. It was incredibly frustrating. You\u2019d be angry about something and she\u2019d go: \u2018Yes darling, but \u2026\u2019\u201d\nLike his mother, he has never shied away from the trickiest \u201cbuts\u201d. When he talks about his appalling loss, he also knows he has been lucky. Not only has he been able to express his grief in his work, but it has also fed his creativity. Even at its bleakest, he has found it cathartic. \u201cMaking art is in itself the great expression of joy and optimism, in my view. That\u2019s why we need it. Music, art, reminds us of our fundamental capacity to create beautiful things out of the fuckeries of life. Even when I\u2019m making The Devil Kills His First Child, I\u2019m not depressed, I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow! Look at the head!\u2019 It\u2019s a joyful occupation, no matter what. And when I\u2019m singing a very sad lyric, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m sad inside.\u201d\nThe forthcoming Bad Seeds album is the first thing he has created since Arthur\u2019s death that isn\u2019t \u201cset through a lens of loss\u201d. He is funny when talking about his work \u2013 so angsty and uncertain early in the process, almost messianic by the end. \u201cThe new album is really good. It\u2019s really strong. Great songs,\u201d he says.\nSimilarly with The Devil \u2013 A Life. He has got over the doubts and now he is buzzing with self-belief. Is he nervous about the exhibition? \u201cNo, I\u2019m excited. I think the ceramics are really good and really strange.\u201d But he feels unusually protective towards his figurines and the story that they tell. \u201cThese guys feel extraordinarily vulnerable. They are vulnerable little things, and they are saying something deeply personal.\u201d\n Nick Cave: The Devil\u2009\u2013\u2009A Life is at Xavier Hufkens in Brussels from 5 April to 11 May\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But how can you work out what suits the moment? And the best way to get rid of a stink? Perfumers reveal how to make your world smell fantastic.1. Smell is an extreme sensation\u201cScent provokes a visceral reaction,\u201d says Ezra-Lloyd Jackson, a perfumer and artist who makes wearable fragrances under the brand name deya and creates scent installations for art exhibitions. What fascinates him about working with scent is the process of transforming \u201csomething that is grotesque or alarming into something that is familiar and comforting, or vice versa\u201d.\n2. Your reaction to a smell is linked to memoryMaya Njie makes perfumes inspired by her Swedish and Gambian heritage. She tried to capture this feeling in other artistic forms before realising that what she really wanted was to portray the way it smelled. \u201cWe know that our sense of smell is directly linked to the part of the brain where our memories are stored,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it makes a lot of sense that fragrance and smells are connected to our memories. If you smell something that someone has worn, or you go to a house that belongs to your grandparents, smelling makes you feel way more emotional than a photo ever could.\u201d Jackson describes this as \u201cinternal time travel. It is another form of communication that isn\u2019t linguistic.\u201d3. It is possible to train your nose\u201cThat is what perfume is all about,\u201d says Jackson. He didn\u2019t have a very orthodox route into perfumery: \u201cI went straight into a laboratory and got to work, but most people will train at one of the schools in France, where the first year is all about learning 500 smells.\u201d Brighton-based French perfumer Elodie Durande, who works for Somerset label Ffern, honed her craft at the University of Montpellier. \u201cYou start out by working on your olfactory skills, remembering smells and describing smells,\u201d before receiving a wide-ranging education about the perfume industry, she says.\nLearning about scent applies not just to those who work in it, but those who wear it, too. \u201cYou can figure out what scent suits you by literally going around in your regular life and being sure to smell,\u201d says Mandy Aftel, a natural perfumer who lives in Berkeley, California and runs a fragrance museum, the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents. \u201cParticipate more in your life, bring your consciousness into a cup of coffee or when you\u2019re baking; smell the oven and the smells of baking will evolve. All we need to do is close our eyes, inhale and be there. And it will become clear to you what you like.\u201d4. You can change how you feel about a smell \u2013 if you want to\u201cIf there is a perfume that someone wore when you were younger and it makes you feel uncomfortable, or an ex-partner wore a perfume and you smell it again, it can be interesting to reclaim that smell,\u201d says Njie. \u201cSo instead of smelling it every now and again, and feeling the way that you do, you would buy a sample of it and start wearing it \u2013 doing things that make you dissociate from that particular person. You can recreate memories and connections to it.\u201d\nBut you should proceed with caution, advises Aftel: \u201cIf a fragrance reminds you of someone who stopped your heart, you should avoid it. It is a part of who you are and that should be honoured. On the other hand, if you really got over that person, it may be a victory dance to feel that it no longer bothers you. But it has to be an evolution inside of you.\u201d\n5. Take your time choosing a fragranceYou need to be in the right mood when shopping for a new scent, explains Lynn Harris, the perfumer behind the Perfume H and Miller Harris labels. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing an item of clothing \u2013 you have to be calm and not in a rush.\u201d Don\u2019t be intimidated by fragrance, she says. Tell the sales assistant the kind of things you like and they will help you to find something.\n6. Pick a fragrance for the time of year \u201cFind a fragrance that fits you for the season,\u201d says Harris. \u201cI think that is key because that is how we treat our wardrobe in general; it needs to be reinvigorated and fragrance is the same, because it will stop working for you just like that. So go into it thinking, \u2018I am going to have one for spring. What do I want? Do I want something fresh? Do I want something green?\u2019 And then in the winter, you may think, \u2018I want something to cocoon me, to nurture me but smell sexy at the same time.\u2019\u201d\n7. Test it on your skin\u201cOnce you\u2019ve found two fragrances that you quite like and they\u2019re doing something for you olfactory-wise, try them on your skin,\u201d says Harris. \u201cOne fragrance on each wrist and perhaps another somewhere up your arm. Try no more than three. It is quite good to take a tester card and then, maybe later in the day, check it and see if it\u2019s doing anything for you. But that initial skin contact and your reaction to it is very important. It should be giving you pleasure; making you feel inquisitive and emotional. Give it three to five minutes and if it\u2019s still working, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d\nFragrance comes to life on the skin, says Njie. \u201cTemperature plays a part, which is why we spray on pulse points and it is why fragrance may come alive more in the summer, whereas in the winter it may be flatter.\u201d\n8. Wear what you like, not what you think you should likeFragrance has traditionally been marketed as \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d \u2013 interestingly, certain flowery notes were once considered the latter \u2013 and something used to attract the object of your affection, says Njie, who makes gender neutral perfumes. \u201cBut really, all those lines are so blurred\u201d \u2013 now, it is more about \u201cmaking you feel a certain way about yourself, more confident or secure or all of these different emotions that fragrance can bring to us\u201d.9. Scent can be used to lift or reflect your mood \u201cAll of my perfumes are very mood driven,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI have some perfumes that are sad, some that are kind of sexy for a date night, others that are relaxing \u2013 like being in nature in the trees.\u201d They can also be chosen to mark a special occasion, such as a birthday, wedding or significant life change. \u201c[You can] dedicate a particular scent to it that isn\u2019t an every day one,\u201d says Jackson, setting yourself up to make new memories with your chosen fragrance.10. Spritz where you will most enjoy it\u201cI spray on my wrist and on the back of my neck,\u201d says Njie, \u201cbecause I find that if you spray it at the front, you smell it constantly and get used to the fragrance faster than you would if it wasn\u2019t in your peripheral area the whole time. I like to spray it on my clothes, if I feel as if I\u2019ve got fabric that can handle it; I like it on a coat sleeve before I leave the house \u2013 that way I can access it more easily. My hair is very short but I know that the girls in the studio spray a bit and walk into it and it wafts in your hair throughout the day.\u201d\nDurande agrees that wearing perfume on your chest means you sense it too much, which soon means that \u201cyou can\u2019t consciously smell it anymore\u201d. The trick instead is to \u201ctry to apply it to different parts of your body, on your wrist or even on your legs \u2013 anywhere that has motion. That way, when you move, you will get a whiff of perfume.\u201d\n11. Don\u2019t be too overpowering\u201cIt is good to keep other people in mind,\u201d says Njie. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in smaller spaces, travelling or working in an office, you may want to take others into account. I don\u2019t believe that if a fragrance reaches across the room and it is eye-watering, then it means that it is good and you have got a lot for your buck. Something that is subdued and more sophisticated can be equally as beautiful. It is nice to have a smell that is more intimate \u2013 that people who come close to you get to enjoy.\u201d\nHarris agrees: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s tasteful to invade other people\u2019s space with fragrance. It should be for you and those immediately close to you.\u201d When you can no longer smell your fragrance, reapply it to a different part of the body, suggests Durande.\n12. Choose something that will last\u201cAnything with a deeper smell \u2013 something woody, ambery, richer \u2013 and sweeter scents like vanilla or caramels \u2026 these are all base notes, the longer lasting ingredients,\u201d says Durande. \u201cPerfumes that contain these will retain on the skin for a bit longer.\u201d\n13. Think sustainablyNjie\u2019s eponymous brand is vegan and \u201coffers refills, and uses recycled glass and paper packaging\u201d. But sustainability in perfume is not always straightforward, so make sure you read up on how brands operate before you buy. \u201cNatural does not equal being more sustainable or safer to wear,\u201d she says. \u201cIn certain cases, the synthetic molecules are better, as they carry a lower carbon footprint and fewer allergens.\u201d\n14. How to tell a dupeThe internet is awash with cunning copies of notable perfumes, and it can be hard to tell a real fragrance from a fake one. \u201cIf it is a really good dupe, you can\u2019t really tell,\u201d says Durande. \u201cIf it is a perfume that you\u2019ve been wearing for many years, every day, and you have a good sense of smell, you will probably pick up tiny differences. Because dupes are never 100% the same, even the good ones.\u201d\n15. Sometimes it is better not to wear anything Durande barely wears fragrance. \u201cI work with smells all day long, all week, so in my free time I need a bit of a reset. I like to be in a neutral environment, to give my nose a bit of a rest,\u201d she says. Being scent-free at work, she explains, means that she can concentrate on smelling her creations all the better.\n16. In the home, embrace how life smells Don\u2019t automatically turn to a candle or incense to give a room character, says Aftel. \u201cA lot of people will scent their home with those tired old fragranced candles that are quite synthetic. But how lovely would it be, say at a dinner party, to put out things that are fragrant that are not a candle, that encourage people to touch them. With a bowl of oranges, the oil is in the skin and they are very beautiful to look at. Or maybe having a little bouquet of mint so people can rip a leaf off. Or, if you have jasmine where you live, put that on the table with a bowl of peaches \u2013 they look and smell incredible together. I grow lemons so I always have a bowl of them out. Something very simple like that is a beautiful way to include fragrance in your life.\u201d\nJackson, meanwhile, likes to embrace the smells of cooking rather than mask them, especially \u201ccardamom, frying sage with butter and cumin, honey and carrots \u2013 a match made in heaven\u201d.\n17. Make your own scent ritualsNjie does use candles and incense in her home. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I tend to do more after I\u2019ve done my chores, and it is time to relax. It\u2019s like a reward for doing something. I wouldn\u2019t light a candle if I\u2019ve got loads of stuff to do.\u201d Durande opts for palo santo or Papier d\u2019Arm\u00e9nie, which reminds her of childhood, for a similar unwinding effect. Jackson cannily sprays radiators with fragrance \u2013 as they warm, the scent is released.\n18. To remove the smell of garlic from hands \u2026\u201cWash your hands with cold water first,\u201d says Durande, \u201cbecause the hot water opens up the pores in your skin. If you clean up with hot water, some of those garlic smells are going to be trapped deeper in your skin. I\u2019ve noticed that if you rinse off or wash your hands with cold water first, it removes it better. You don\u2019t get so much in your skin, and then you can do a second wash with warm water and soap.\u201d\n19. Consider your laundry detergent \u201cThe stuff that people use to scent laundry sticks around for so long,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI believe very strongly in a person choosing to engage with a smell and choosing when it comes to an end. So if you have stuff that lasts for a really long time, or blankets things, I feel like the person smelling it may falsely think they don\u2019t like it, or that it\u2019s too much. A natural smell has an arc over time. They last, then \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 disappear.\u201d\n20. To get rid of a bad smell \u2026\u201cI would just open a window and get a draught going,\u201d says Njie. \u201cBecause otherwise you\u2019re layering over the bad smell \u2013 it is better to try to get rid of it.\u201d Aftel suggests putting frankincense resin over a tea light: \u201cIt fills your house with a beautiful, natural smell and you could cover something up with that very easily.\u201d Aside from that, she adds, simply \u201copen the windows and pray\u201d."},

Sure, it has its perks \u2013 more energy, first loves, first everythings \u2013 but I feel for the under-25s with still so many life hurdles left to clear. With the list of current social ills ranging from the housing crisis to social isolation and the any-day-now background note of environmental doom, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not easy for young people today.\nSo when research last week from MoneySuperMarket found that driving age under-25s were costing their parents \u00a31,300 a year in additional fuel from being ferried around \u2013 sparking unpleasant commentary about feckless young people \u201crefusing\u201d to drive \u2013 I found myself thinking: \u201cLeave the kids alone, they\u2019re doing their best!\u201d\nThat is not to dismiss the additional burden on parents. Fuel prices are some of the highest ever recorded. And with only one in four 17 to 20-year-olds holding a driving licence compared to one in two in 1989, many families will be feeling it. The reason why? Getting on the road costs an obscene amount: an average of \u00a37,600 with hikes in insurance and car prices included, which, once adjusted, is well over double the cost in 1989. Few young people today will have access to that sort of cash so will wait until they are older and earning more.\nI know, because I did. I passed my driving test six years ago, just weeks before my 30th birthday. I remember it well: the fail for hesitation, the fail for being pushy, the guilt about spending more on lessons because I\u2019d failed. But then \u2013 the pass! The ecstasy of a first automatic machine car-wash \u2013 the ASMR sound of success! Trust me, it may be later in life but this rite of passage still zings the same. Just offer your thirtysomething non-driver friend a lift home, or take them to a drive-thru and see the love in their eyes. You are suddenly the coolest person in sixth form. Just 15 years later.\nFortunately, while some gripe about young should-be drivers, people are more kind on TikTok. Driving instructors use the site to share tips and there is a trend of \u201celder\u201d TikTok influencers (and by that I mean, 28-year-olds) sharing their failures and passes to encourage younger learners. Personally, I feel this may be my calling. So maybe someone needs to hear this: \u201cHey, driver in progress, please know, you aren\u2019t a failure. You may have taken a wrong turn but you\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\n Coco Khan is a freelance writer and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UK"},

Seemingly everyone has a \u201cproven track record for delivering results\u201d and a \u201cbelief in integrated solutions\u201d (one of those buzz phrases that makes less sense the more you think about it. Doesn\u2019t everyone have a belief in integrated solutions? Or are there some people out there thinking: \u201cI personally hate joined-up thinking\u201d). Others have an emotive, possibly too-much-information story to share (\u201cI failed my exams at school, got married young, got divorced young, but now I work at Google and have a spicy girlfriend\u201d), and many want to \u201creach out\u201d \u2013 please, no touching in the workplace! \u2013 to discuss unnamed \u201copportunities\u201d.\nNow, you may be reading this thinking: \u201cWho cares? Let them have their space and stay off the platform if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d And ordinarily, I might agree. But then I watched my brilliant friend \u2013 my accomplished, talented friend \u2013 crumble in the face of it. Her journey has been non-linear: market stalls to magazines, counselling training and now HR. In my view, her work experience is diverse, rich and what makes her excellent at her job, but it doesn\u2019t fit neatly in the boxes of LinkedIn. It upset her to try to upload her life into this format \u2013 where dates had to be applied and money assigned (how do you get around the mandatory \u201cadd date\u201d for the experience of motherhood and informal childcare in your neighbourhood? Are you \u201cfreelancing\u201d if you organise community art events for nothing but a sense of civic pride?). She felt uncomfortable trading in grandiose statements of \u201cpersonal transformation\u201d, even though she has been on more of a journey than many users on the platform. But job vacancy adverts increasingly say \u201capply with your LinkedIn\u201d, and everyone in her field has joined the Stepford employees. I can see why she felt this is what she had to do \u2013 that employers would look for it, and she needed to be there; that if she didn\u2019t compete, she\u2019d be left behind.\nMuch has been written about how tech is changing how we see ourselves and each other. Instagram pushing unattainable beauty standards and lifestyles, Facebook fake news chipping away at people\u2019s belief in institutions, an X format that reduces a complex thought to 280 characters (no wonder nuance is impossible!), turning all of us into outrage addicts. Dating apps have commodified and gamified those most human phenomena: love and desire. Yet somehow LinkedIn has been left out of the spotlight. But here\u2019s my contention: I think it is doing something to us, shifting how we see our accomplishments, what we assign value to and what we don\u2019t. And perhaps most chilling of all, it promotes the idea that we are all just brands, and we must always \u2013 always \u2013 be selling. Apparently, LinkedIn is now being used as a full social network, a place where people talk about their marriages, make friends and maybe even date. What does that tell us about our lives outside work? Do we even still have lives outside work at all?\nPerhaps what is needed is a bit of real and refreshing honesty on LinkedIn. What could it look like, I wonder? I\u2019ll go first.\nHello, I am Coco. I have a proven track record of not responding to text messages in a timely manner.

They were caught spreading election disinformation against Labour\u2019s London mayor on the day that Conservative ministers accused Chinese hackers of meddling in democracy by targeting Beijing\u2019s opponents in the UK.\nThe Conservative party did delete footage of a panicked crowd at a New York subway station, which it used to falsely state that London had become a \u201ccrime capital of the world\u201d, after online criticism. But the rest of the video, with its spurious claims, remained up on Tuesday evening.\nSadiq Khan, who is standing for re-election for a third term as London mayor this May, rightly condemned the Tory video as lies and misinformation. The Conservative party is resorting to underhand tactics and fake news because it has an uninspiring candidate, Susan Hall, in London and is far behind in the polls. In January, the Tories posted an attack video on social media that misrepresented comments by Mr Khan to make it look as if he was proud to be antisemitic. The Conservative party shamefully refused to take it down.\nIt would be easy to dismiss the campaign advert as simply ludicrous. But it is also dangerous in its embrace of conspiracy-minded tropes, some of which are popular among the far right. It claims that masked Ulez enforcers, represented by a shadowy figure in a dark alleyway, are \u201cterrorising communities\u201d, and that the Ulez policy is \u201cforcing people to stay inside or go underground\u201d.\nMr Khan lives under 24-hour police protection. But the threat from disinformation is not only to him. The mayor warned that AI-generated audio which purported to capture him making incendiary remarks about Remembrance weekend last year almost caused serious disorder after it was widely shared by the far right. Fake news can \u2013 thanks to social media \u2013 spread as never before. This makes it far more dangerous. Political deepfakes, if left unchallenged, could have profound implications for journalism, voter ethics, and the quality of democracy.\nPerhaps the Tories hope that many will share their fake videos because, even though voters know the content is false, the stories stir up resentment. The Tory party has long seeded these clouds. Mr Khan is England\u2019s most high-profile Muslim politician, but he has not been defined by his faith. This has not stopped his opponent, who has falsely told fellow Tories that Jewish Londoners were frightened of Mr Khan\u2019s \u201cdivisive attitude\u201d. An investigation into Ms Hall\u2019s social media posts found she had repeatedly endorsed racially charged abuse of Labour\u2019s mayor.\nThe Tory party has also attempted to create more favourable terms for itself in London, a Labour stronghold, by changing from a preferential voting system to first past the post. This was a step back for electoral reform, but combined with voter ID requirements, it made Mr Khan\u2019s return to office harder. But so does his incumbency.\nThe social costs of virally spreading false information are real. In Europe, the posting of anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook has been correlated with violent attacks on refugees. Voters are also worse off when they believe false statements because disinformation has made it almost impossible for them to choose high-quality candidates. If we want a democratic society with policies that respond to evidence, then we must pay attention to the changing character of propaganda and develop suitable responses.\n This article was amended on 27 March 2024.

Plus letters from a pensioner who was evicted after asking his landlord to fix damp problems, Daniel Carter and Martyn Williams", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.35 CET", "content": "Nick Bano makes a compelling argument that discussions about increasing the housing supply are misguided if their aim is to fix the UK housing crisis (The end of landlords: the surprisingly simple solution to the UK housing crisis, 19 March). His\u00a0data and succinct description of\u00a0the historical context are consistent with qualitative and quantitative evidence provided by\u00a0various UK housing scholars.\nAs part of my work as a computational economist, I try to understand the connections between housing wealth inequality and the set of incentives that are shaped by institutions such as the market and the government, ie \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d. For this purpose, I develop artificial intelligence models consisting of a computational representation of every household and property in the economy (with their most relevant characteristics and behaviours), and the rules of the game that incentivise them to engage in interactions such as purchasing and renting real estate.\nThese \u201cdigital twins\u201d of the UK housing market generate data that are consistent with official statistics, so one can simulate detailed policy interventions that, in the real world, would be impossible to test under constrained time and financial\u00a0resources.\nBano\u2019s arguments resonate with a study where I find that increasing the housing stock would be a poor choice of intervention if the policy target was reducing housing wealth inequality. However, and contrasting with Bano\u2019s view on a simple solution, my research suggests that housing policy interventions would need to be rather nuanced, well-timed and carefully coordinated, for example, by considering regional differences, target populations, financial incentives, income sources, and how taxes are instrumented. Many of these factors are indeed addressed by commentators, policymakers and academics, but\u00a0in a scattered manner.\nPerhaps it is time to bring these different perspectives together through the analytic prowess of AI methods to scrutinise policy proposals and formulate holistic solutions to one of the most pressing and complex socioeconomic issues in Britain.Dr Omar A GuerreroHead of computational social\u00a0science research, The Alan Turing Institute\n The collapse of landlordism is indeed a noble aim whose achievement would remove one of the biggest factors in social deprivation and inequality in the UK. But as a former tenant who has just been evicted under section 21, the so-called no-fault eviction law, I believe we need to recognise the bigger picture, the wider vested interests in maintaining the system of injustice and exploitation that underpins our housing crisis.\nMy wife and I are pensioners evicted for daring to ask our landlord to fix damp, mould and rain coming into our home.\nWe had plenty of things to say in court to defend ourselves against eviction, not just the landlord\u2019s criminal negligence in failing to maintain the property in a safe, habitable state, but the debt collection agency thug hired by the landlord\u2019s insurance company to terrorise us in our home to make us leave. We have never been in rent arrears by so much as a penny. We were not allowed to mention a word of this in court and were duly\u00a0forced into expensive temporary accommodation by the arrival of the bailiffs.\nThere is a vast empire of dishonest and unscrupulous operators helping to drive up homelessness and trap millions in miserable, unsafe housing. It includes landlords in parliament supporting blatantly unfair laws, big legal and insurance firms, unprincipled lawyers and the courts. The landlords are just the\u00a0tip of the\u00a0iceberg.Name and address supplied\n I was delighted to see that someone is finally talking about the elephant in the room in regard to our housing crisis, and that it has a name: landlordism. Far too much political energy has been wasted discussing damaging and dead-end housing policies like building all over the green belt, pushing up prices with \u201chelp to buy\u201d, or punishing council housing tenants with spare bedrooms.\nMy own family lived in several private rented sector properties in an expensive area for 15 years before we were finally offered (also very expensive) social housing. Based on an average rent of around \u00a31,100 per month over that period, we lined the pockets of our landlords to the tune of almost \u00a3200,000 \u2013 money earned through our own hard work and that of the taxpayers who fund housing benefit.\nSurely the answer is to create straighforward disincentives to owning property simply in order to make easy money from other people\u2019s effort. How hard is it to pass a law abolishing six-month contracts and no-fault evictions? How about taxing the passive wealth earned by landlords? Why is it taboo to discuss rent controls? It might be enough to make them sell up and earn an honest living.Daniel CarterCambridge\n I am what you might call a good landlord, reasonable and caring and not what I would term greedy. There are many like me. I keep my houses in good order and look after my tenants. There is a fair amount of social housing in an appalling condition, so how can the solution be to take all rented housing into the state and charitable sector?\nWould it not be better to root out all examples of unsafe and unhealthy housing in whichever sector, rather than penalise one over the other? Fair rents, yes.

Thatcher\u2019s legacy, right to buy, is a failure, 26 March). Putting it bluntly, it was a brilliant way for the Conservatives to bribe a large sector of mainly Labour voters to switch.\nThe significant discounts offered made buying one\u2019s council house a huge bargain. What is more, in terms of housing provision, it did not benefit the sitting tenants as much as giving a substantial gift to their children, who often provided the initial capital knowing that they would inherit the house and make a big gain on its sale or on its subsequent letting for profit.\nIn cities like my own, with a large stock of council houses, their councils found that right to buy was mainly taken up by those in better areas and on the fringe of more problem estates, and they were left with properties to let in more difficult areas. One direct effect was to reduce greatly the opportunity for existing tenants to obtain transfers to better or more appropriate houses for their needs, and this produced much distress and bitterness among such\u00a0individuals.\nThe policy was a cynical and electorally successful way of abusing public funds for political ends.Michael MeadowcroftFormer Leeds city councillor\n I was brought up at the edge of Dogsthorpe, a large council estate in Peterborough built in the 1950s to house workers in the nearby engineering factories. Council housing had one huge advantage: it allowed local authorities to decide who lived where. Applicants were placed on priority lists based on size of family and need, and houses were allocated accordingly.\nThe right-to-buy scheme has meant that many of those houses are now in the hands of private landlords, and what local authority housing is left is insufficient and fragmented. Had council housing still been in existence, the private rental sector would have been smaller and less significant.\nCouncil housing allowed the state (local councils) more control over housing. That control has now largely gone, and the phrase \u201cclosing the stable door after the horse has bolted\u201d comes to mind.Toby WoodPeterborough\n Keir Starmer, in refusing to scrap right to buy in England, leaves himself the option to extend it to tenants of private landlords. The houses would be sold at a discount, taking into account the original purchase price and improvements. This would lower both private rents and the prices of starter homes.Dr Orest MulkaSnarestone, Leicestershire\n Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

But little hope is still hope. When I read Owen Jones\u2019s article my heart sank, and I fear facing another five years staring into the austere blue abyss (The Labour party is in my blood. Here\u2019s why I\u2019ve just cancelled my membership, 21 March). Is Jones really helping? He\u2019s made it clear in his article and video that voting for what feels like our only option to end Tory rule is a terrible idea. Despite his optimistic attempt to promote vague alternatives to Labour, I feel more cynical.\nIn every election I have voted in, the Conservatives have always won. They\u2019re good at winning. The first time I think my Labour vote could be used to oust them, Jones tries to convince us not to bother.\nUp against millions more pounds in campaign funding, and constituency boundary changes, I\u2019m not confident Labour has this one in the bag. Though the Greens care deeply about our planet\u2019s future survival and some independents are seeking power for the people, splitting the left-leaning vote is not practical. Starmer-branded boring practicality is the best hope we have against a populist government rushing to the extreme right. Clarice Francis London\n Owen Jones recommends that people who think that Labour has somehow betrayed them should support the Greens or independents at the next election. While voting for one of these candidates might well assuage his own personal moral outrage at Labour\u2019s supposed failings, these groups are never likely to form a government, but could well damage Keir Starmer\u2019s chance of securing a parliamentary majority. So, the questions is: would he, and those who think like him, prefer to have another five years of the Tory party smashing up what\u2019s\u00a0left of the welfare state?Richard EllisStoke-on-Trent\n Owen Jones\u2019s article strikes a resonant chord. What is the point of being in government if the Labour party does nothing in office to move forward the lot of the less privileged members of society? Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies may have failed to sway the electorate, but they did show positive and progressive intent and a direction of travel that appealed to a great many.\nI\u2019ve just returned from an evening at the National Theatre celebrating the achievement of Aneurin Bevan, the leading architect and inspiration for the NHS. While celebrating its foundation, the play also eloquently makes the case for nursing the NHS back to health. The Labour party must show real leadership and devise policies that truly inspire. Philip Huggett London\n Like Owen Jones, I too am dismayed by the dismantling of Labour party values and beliefs. Now 74 years old, I too was a lifelong supporter and member of the party, a working-class girl raised by a single mother who believed, as I do, in shared support and care in society. I have two of her paintings of the Jarrow March on the wall of my home. I have been called many things, from \u201cmisguided\u201d to \u201cdangerous\u201d, because of my views.\nI resigned my membership of the party when it became clear after the EU referendum that they would never raise the flag of opposition and change.

{"headline": "Britain is becoming a toxic chemical dumping ground \u2013 yet another benefit of Brexit", "author": "George Monbiot", "teaser": "Perhaps our government imagines bulldog spirit will protect us from the dangerous substances that Europe rules unsafe", "published": "Mon 18 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "It\u2019s a benefit of Brexit \u2013 but only if you\u2019re a manufacturer or distributor of toxic chemicals. For the rest of us, it\u2019s another load we have to carry on behalf of the shysters and corner-cutters who lobbied for the UK to leave the EU.\nThe government insisted on a separate regulatory system for chemicals. At first sight, it\u2019s senseless: chemical regulation is extremely complicated and expensive. Why replicate an EU system that costs many millions of euros and employs a small army of scientists and administrators? Why not simply adopt as UK standards the decisions it makes? After all, common regulatory standards make trading with the rest of Europe easier. Well, now we know. A separate system allows the UK to become a dumping ground for the chemicals that Europe rules unsafe.\nWhile negotiating our exit from the EU, the government repeatedly promised that environmental protections would not be eroded. In 2018, for example, the then environment secretary Michael Gove, in a speech titled Green Brexit, claimed \u201cnot only will there be no abandonment of the environmental principles that we\u2019ve adopted in our time in the EU, but indeed we aim to strengthen environmental protection measures\u201d. Such pledges turn out to be as dodgy as a \u00a33 coin with Boris Johnson\u2019s head on it.\nOur proudly sovereign regulatory system immediately descended into total chaos: chaos of the kind that the warlord capitalists who backed the leave campaign might have been hoping for. It took the UK\u2019s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) until last month to publish its chemicals regulation work programme for the financial year 2023-2024. That was, erm, six weeks before the period expired. You\u2019ll remember, of course, how Brexit would enable us to escape the \u201cinefficiencies\u201d of Brussels bureaucracy.\nAs the campaign group Chem Trust documents, our shadow version of the EU system, called UK Reach, is beset by underfunding, understaffing, a skills crisis and an impossible workload. It looks to me like the kind of failure-by-design that afflicts so much of environmental regulation in the UK.\nThis dysfunction leaves us exposed to toxins now being banned or restricted in Europe. For example, tetraethyl lead has long been banned from fuel for surface vehicles. But it continues to be used in aircraft fuel, ensuring we are sprayed with a chemical that causes neurological disorders. The EU, after long resisting the obvious step, has at last ruled that it must be phased out. But the UK hasn\u2019t. It will remain legal here. The same goes for endocrine-disrupting chemicals in children\u2019s toys, formaldehyde, brominated flame retardants and the microplastics intentionally added to fertilisers and artificial sport surfaces.\nThe EU is far from perfect. It has backtracked on some of its own commitments. But at least it\u2019s doing something about chemicals that cause cancers and other illnesses and devastate ecosystems. Since we left the bloc, UK regulators have yet to adopt a single new ban or restriction of a harmful substance. Brings a lump to the throat, this patriotic self-reliance, doesn\u2019t it? Or perhaps to the breast, or stomach, or liver.\nIn some respects, we\u2019ve even been spiralling backwards. The government has decided that workplace exposure limits on dimethylformamide, and restrictions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in synthetic sports pitches, of lead in PVC products and of hazardous substances in disposable nappies are \u201cnot a priority for action this year\u201d. Part of its reasoning is that it has yet to see evidence that these substances pose a risk that is \u201cspecific to Great Britain\u201d. Does their use in the UK present different risks to their identical use elsewhere? Perhaps the bulldog spirit of this sceptred isle protects us from chemicals that afflict the lesser beings overseas.\nIn the EU, there is now a total ban on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides \u2013 perhaps better labelled ecocides, thanks to their remarkably wide range of impacts. But every year since we left the EU, the UK government has granted an \u201cemergency\u201d exemption from the supposed ban here, following lobbying by sugar beet producers and the National Farmers Union. In August 2020, British Sugar asked for \u201cno more than three years\u2026 to give us time to develop alternatives\u201d. Given that it granted yet another authorisation in 2024, perhaps the government could ask British Sugar\u2019s managing director how his company is getting along. He shouldn\u2019t be hard to find. He\u2019s married to the health secretary.\nThe more we learn, the more we realise how dangerous chemicals approved without proper testing or consideration can be. New findings, for instance, on the health effects of PFAS compounds \u2013 \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2013 and on the ecological and health impacts of pesticides, and on the effects of microplastics in soil show why we should apply the precautionary principle. By the time we discover that a substance is more hazardous than first believed, it is embedded in our ecosystems, our bodies and our lives.\nWhile the UK government appears incapable of developing new public protections, it is also mysteriously unable, following lobbying, donations and taps on the shoulder, to uphold and enforce the regulations we do possess. Every body that\u2019s supposed to protect us from environmental harm \u2013 such as the Environment Agency or the HSE \u2013 is woefully underfunded, underpowered and demoralised. This is where most deregulation happens: not in the formation or de-formation of rules, which, at least in theory, is subject to parliamentary debate, but in the government\u2019s unwillingness to apply them, which is not.\nThis is why a group of us, called Fighting Dirty, are taking the government to court over its multiple failures to protect people and ecosystems from hazardous chemicals, beginning with its outrageous refusal to test or regulate the many toxins being spread on farmland in sewage sludge. We have just been granted permission for a high court hearing. Such legal actions, difficult and expensive as they are, are a last resort, when regulatory standards and the agencies supposed to uphold them have all but collapsed.\nBrexit was sold to us on the grounds of intangible gains: a sense of autonomy and pride, particularity and independence. These intangible gains are accompanied by tangible losses: real impacts on our health and wellbeing. We might have left the EU, but we did not escape the demands of predatory capital. Far from it: freed from European restraints, they trickle insidiously into our lives.\nGeorge Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\nJoin George Monbiot for a Guardian Live online event on Wednesday 8 May 2024 at 8pm BST.

{"headline": "Loyalty was once the glue that held the Tories together. But now they\u2019ve come unstuck ", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "teaser": "Claims of a leadership bid are \u2018bonkers\u2019, say Penny Mordaunt\u2019s allies. But so too is staying silent while the PM stumbles towards an election", "published": "Mon 18 Mar 2024 17.04 CET", "content": "There are many good reasons for Rishi Sunak to postpone a general election. All are about reducing his party\u2019s potential loss of seats. There is also an overwhelming reason for calling one now. It is in the national interest.\nBritish government needs an act of cleansing. It needs renewal and a fresh start under a new regime. Every month that start is delayed has a cost in decisions postponed. The presumed next government of Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is waiting and ready to go. Its learning curve will be steep and its climb hard. There is not the remotest national advantage in another six months of bickering and squabbling.\nAffliction descends weekly on Sunak\u2019s head. He has shown himself to be an honest and articulate prime minister during probably the toughest episode in modern British politics. But his party and his government machine have failed him. The Rwanda bill, questionable donors, bankrupt councils, tax cuts, extremism laws and defence spending tumble out of Downing Street in a chaotic shambles.\nNow he must confront an alleged plot to replace him with Penny Mordaunt, the apparent favourite of Tory moderates, who several MPs claim has been \u201con manoeuvres\u201d for several months. While Mordaunt herself has not commented publicly, her supporters have called the claims \u201cbonkers\u201d \u2013 and such a bid would indeed be destabilising, just when Sunak most needs support.\nMordaunt is currently leader of the House of Commons. She heads the central oligarchy of power in Britain, the party of government in parliament. Of all cabinet members, her duty is one of absolute loyalty to her leader. Yet she and others remain silent as Sunak trips and stumbles from one calamity to another. Parliamentary lobby journalists gaily disseminate challenges to his leadership. His enemies mostly remain anonymous and, for all we know, may not exist, while his named supporters make the most obvious remark: that a fourth leadership contest in five years would indicate a party unfit for a minute longer in government.\nThroughout Conservative history, the party\u2019s unity has been cited as its secret weapon, manifest as loyalty to the leader of the day. There have been two occasions postwar when it has been as hard-pressed as now. One was in 1964 under Alec Douglas-Home and the other in 1997 under John Major. In both cases, the leader was challenged, respectively by Enoch Powell and by the anti-EU \u201cbastards\u201d. But come election time, loyalty held. The party went dignified into opposition and leadership hopefuls bided their time.\nThere is no dignity now. Mordaunt is a modern politician who, like Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, can fill a room and please a crowd. She did not seem to merit cabinet promotion, other than briefly, over the past troublesome years, as defence secretary for 85 days. She is of the populist rather than executive stream of British politician.\nThis could be a strength, if she were ever to make a leadership bid, but Tory leaders including Margaret Thatcher have been careful to surround themselves with a tight cabal of ministerial talent. It was Johnson\u2019s mass expulsion of such talent in 2019 \u2013 fearing for his position \u2013 that has left the party so denuded of leadership ability today. The deplorable state of the cabinet machine during the pandemic is the one message of the otherwise useless Covid inquiry.\nAs the political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville declared, every political party in Britain is essentially a club. Its ability to act in unison is its greatest strength. That is why Britain has always found it impossible to devolve real power to national or local governments. But the club demands its members obey the rules. One of the great strengths of the historical Labour party was to adapt the discipline of the trade union to parliament.\nThe Tories have suffered factional splits in recent decades, variously into the Referendum, Brexit, UK Independence and Reform parties. The Conservative party has survived them all, admittedly with help from the first-past-the-post system. The present challenge from Reform looks superficially serious, though its former leader, Nigel Farage, is carefully biding his time. Who knows \u2013 but his future may yet be with the Tories.\nThe clear possibility hovers on the horizon of a Farage-Johnson-Mordaunt \u201cred wall\u201d coalition. It could relaunch a \u201cNew Tory\u201d party \u2013 on the model of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour \u2013 amid the putative ruins of a Starmer government. What is different today is the lack of any critical mass of respectable Toryism to offer it resistance. At the prospect of such a future we can only tremble.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "Rachel Reeves is staking it all on economic growth. So where\u2019s her plan to achieve it?", "author": "Larry Elliott", "teaser": "Promising to reform the planning system, boost investment and improve skills is all very well, but the detail is missing", "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 18.37 CET", "content": "The pursuit of growth is an obsession for politicians the world over. Olaf Scholz thinks more growth would make him a more popular German chancellor. Xi Jinping sets growth targets in China and they are invariably met. Here in Britain, Rachel Reeves mentioned the word 58 times when she delivered the prestigious Mais lecture this week.\nThe almost fetishistic worship of gross domestic product as a measure of how well a country is doing is curious, because even the statisticians responsible for producing economic data accept it is an incomplete performance measure. GDP rises as a result of cleaning up after oil spills, but takes no account of the benefits of unpaid work. As a yardstick, it is clearly flawed.\nA classic example of GDP\u2019s limitations came just this week with the release of the 2024 World Happiness report. This showed that the US had dropped out of the top 20 list of happiest nations despite being comfortably the fastest growing of the G7 developed economies in recent years.\nThe study suggests much more attention should be paid to rising levels of misery among Americans aged 15 to 24 and rather less to whether the quarterly GDP figures show growth accelerating or not. Sadly, that almost certainly won\u2019t happen because higher levels of growth are axiomatically considered to be a good thing while any fall in GDP is viewed as a disaster. In the grand scheme of things, it didn\u2019t matter much that Britain had slipped into technical recession after two successive quarters of negative growth in the second half of last year, but it was still seen as a big setback for the government.\nThis obsession with GDP is relatively modern. As Daniel Susskind writes in his book Growth: A Reckoning, to be published next month, Adam Smith and Karl Marx both saw themselves as moral scientists rather than economists, a tradition that was abandoned in the second half of the 20th century. Today, \u201cpractical people who use economic ways of reasoning about the world are encouraged to flatten multidimensional moral questions like \u2018how should one live?\u2019 into simple technical ones, such as \u2018how can we increase GDP?\u2019,\u201d he writes.\nJudging by what she said in her Mais lecture, Reeves is aware of the drawbacks of GDP, noting that a model based on the pursuit of \u201cnarrow-based, narrowly shared growth\u201d would neither lead to higher living standards, nor command democratic consent.\nUnless Rishi Sunak makes the greatest comeback since Muhammed Ali floored George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle 50 years ago, Reeves is going to be this country\u2019s first female chancellor before long, so what she thinks matters. Labour\u2019s large and consistent opinion poll lead suggests voters have stopped listening to the Tories and are ready for change.\nReeves says she will improve Britain\u2019s growth rate \u2013 which has been weak since the global financial crisis of 2008. She has little time for those who say higher growth is not just undesirable but harmful to the planet, and insists what she is aiming for is rapid growth that benefits everybody and is environmentally sustainable. There can be no durable plan for economic stability and no sustainable plan for economic growth that is not also a serious plan for net zero, she says.\nThese aims are laudable. Until about 250 years ago, living standards for the average person had remained unchanged not just for hundreds but for thousands of years. For most people it was a short, miserable, subsistence existence. The higher levels of growth since the dawn of the industrial age mean people live longer, eat better and stay healthier than their forebears.\nSo when growth rates fall, as they have across the world since the financial crisis of 2008, it is clearly a concern. Slower growth means less tax revenue and less money on public services. Unless governments are prepared to break out of their self-imposed fiscal straitjackets and borrow more, which they are reluctant to do, growth offers a seemingly pain-free escape route.\nAsked in the question-and-answer section at the end of her Mais lecture whether she would \u201crun the economy hot\u201d, Reeves said that wouldn\u2019t be her approach. She will leave it up to the Bank of England to set interest rates and will run all her tax, spending and borrowing decisions past the Office for Budget Responsibility. There will be no attempt to replicate Joe Biden\u2019s subsidies to boost green industry because Britain lacks the US\u2019s fiscal firepower. Labour\u2019s flagship policy \u2013 the green prosperity plan \u2013 has been watered down. Instead, she says she can deliver faster growth by working on the structural problems of the economy: reforming the planning system, boosting investment and improving skills.\nLet\u2019s be clear. There are problems on the economy\u2019s supply side that need fixing, and Reeves\u2019s proposals might make a modest difference. But as Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, said in response to the Mais lecture, as yet they don\u2019t add up to a plan that would transform the economy.\n\u201cRipping up building regulations and tinkering in the public sector are not going to deliver serious growth \u2013 that\u2019s for the birds. Only sustained long-term public investment in our crumbling infrastructure can turn the tide on decline,\u201d Graham said.\nReeves has things going for her. Inflation is falling. Interest rates will be cut by the Bank of England in response. Recovery should be well under way by the time Labour comes to power. But then what? Green growth is certainly a desirable goal. Reeves has yet to show she can deliver it.\nLarry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor"},
{"headline": "The Labour party is in my blood. Here\u2019s why I\u2019ve just cancelled my membership ", "author": "Owen Jones", "teaser": "My ancestors had their own complex relationships with the party, but they could point to policies that transformed people\u2019s lives. In 2024, I cannot say the same", "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "It\u2019s difficult to disentangle Labour from my sense of self. Grew up in Stockport, looks a bit like Macaulay Culkin, bad dress sense \u2026 the Labour party always seemed to fit in there somewhere. My great-grandfather, a railwayman who had his wages docked in the General Strike nearly a century ago, was a Labour councillor. So was my grandmother; her proudest achievement was stopping a family being evicted by a private landlord over Christmas. My parents met at an open-air Labour meeting outside Tooting Bec in the 1960s (romantic). My mother bought me a Labour membership as a 15th birthday present. Under every Labour leader in my 21 years of adult life, I\u2019ve plumped for the party\u2019s candidates at local, national and European level, and campaigned for them to boot.\nAnd yet, after a uniquely calamitous 14-year stretch of Tory rule, just as Labour looks set to reconquer No 10 by a landslide, I\u2019ve just emailed the party cancelling my membership. My committed critics will understandably seek to link the two: Labour has shed its aversion to electability, and off sulks Home Alone\u2019s patron saint of unelectable ideas.\nBut my decision isn\u2019t based on a desire to see Labour for ever in the wilderness. Reaching it has been a gradual, painful process of realising the party won\u2019t even do the bare minimum to improve people\u2019s lives, or to tackle the crises that have led Britain to catastrophe; and that it will, in fact, wage war on anyone who wants to do either\u2013 making anyone with politics to the left of Peter Mandelson feel like a pariah on borrowed time. Yes, my relatives had conflicted relationships with the party, and were often frustrated by its insufficient radicalism. But they could always point to policies that transformed the lives of the people Labour was founded to represent, from the welfare state to the minimum wage and the NHS, where my grandmother worked for her whole life.\nThe premise of Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership bid in 2020 was that popular policies such as taxing the rich to invest in public services, scrapping tuition fees and promoting public ownership were not to blame for the party\u2019s 2019 electoral rout. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s 2017 election manifesto, Starmer declared, was the party\u2019s \u201cfoundational document\u201d \u2013 centred around such commitments and credited with the party\u2019s biggest surge in vote share since 1945, even if it wasn\u2019t enough to win two years after a shattering defeat. \u201cJeremy Corbyn made our party the party of anti-austerity,\u201d Starmer told shattered Labour members, \u201cand he was right to do so.\u201d Though I didn\u2019t vote for him, his pitch gave hope for the broad church my ancestors believed in. In response, I wrote a column titled: \u201cStarmer can succeed, and he deserves our support.\u201d\nYet five years on, Labour has become a hostile environment for anyone believing in the very policies Starmer relied upon to secure the leadership. Sure, Tony Blair\u2019s leadership bid didn\u2019t include laying waste Iraq, but he didn\u2019t pretend to be a slicker version of Tony Benn either. \u201cCircumstances changed,\u201d plead Starmer\u2019s defenders. Weird, then, that according to Margaret Hodge, she was led to believe by a Starmer ally during the leadership election that he was \u201clying\u201d in order to get the job. Weird, too, that during that same campaign Starmer told Andrew Neil that nationalisation of utilities would feature in a Labour manifesto, but 18 months later said: \u201cI never made a commitment to nationalisation.\u201d\nAh, the luxury of a Guardian columnist, goes the predictable retort, demanding the most vulnerable pay the price for his lofty principles. Consider, though, that ending the two-child benefit cap would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, and lessen the effects of poverty on a further 850,000, but Starmer backed keeping it anyway. Why? To sound tough, presumably. On who? Impoverished children, like those I grew up with in Stockport? This is the same Labour party that has ruled out bringing back a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses or instituting a wealth tax. The same Labour party committed to Tory fiscal rules that lock the country into dismal austerity policies that have delivered collapsing public services and an unprecedented decline in living standards. The same Labour party that gutted its one distinctive flagship policy, a \u00a328bn-a-year green investment fund, not because it came under pressure, but because it feared it might.\nSome argue that Labour is doing a Clark Kent, and will unveil its hidden progressive Superman upon assuming office. Yet those fiscal rules make that approach impossible, even if you disregard the propensity of Labour governments to become more rightwing in office.\nThe assault on Gaza, the great crime of our age, adds moral indecency to the pile of dishonesty and vacuity. When Starmer declared Israel had the right to cut off energy and water to Palestinian civilians, he did so as a human rights lawyer who understands the Geneva conventions. After letting shadow cabinet ministers defend him, he claimed it \u201chas never been my view that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines\u201d. We all have political red lines: mine is supporting what would amount to war crimes against innocent civilians, toddlers and newborn babies among them, then gaslighting the public over doing so.\nWhere is my gratitude for Starmer delivering a now inevitable landslide victory, you may ask? Well, he didn\u2019t force Boris Johnson and his cronies to violate their own pandemic rules, or to trash the NHS, or oversee the worst squeeze in living standards in history. Nor did he propel to power Liz Truss, whose unhinged economic experiment crashed the economy \u2013 the moment when the electorate turned on this Tory party for good.\nThe absolute power a landslide victory will give Labour should scare you. When Starmer allies deployed antisemitic tropes \u2013 with one joking about a \u201crun on silver shekels\u201d when two Jewish businessmen missed out on peerages, and another calling a Jewish Tory donor a \u201cpuppet master\u201d \u2013 an apology was deemed to be sufficient. When another racially abused a journalist and had a sexual harassment complaint upheld, they were reinstated after investigation.\nContrast this with Diane Abbott, Britain\u2019s first Black female MP, who was suspended after immediately apologising for an Observer letter in which she argued that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people are not subject to racism \u201call their lives\u201d. She has been left in limbo for 10 months and counting while the party investigates \u2013 only for Labour to use the racist abuse directed at her by a Tory donor for political capital, while still refusing to reinstate her.\nAnother fellow leftwinger, Kate Osamor \u2013 again, a Black female MP \u2013 was suspended for describing the assault on Gaza as a genocide on the day the international court of justice placed Israel on trial for alleged genocide. Questions of racism, then, seem to be judged on whether they have a factional use \u2013 a sure sign of moral bankruptcy. This leadership style is crude in opposition; with an overwhelming majority, it will be chilling.\nThat is why I think those who believe in real change from the Tories\u2019 bankrupt model should vote for Green or independent candidates. A new initiative \u2013 We Deserve Better \u2013 is raising money to support such candidates, judged on whether they believe in, say, taxing the well-off to invest, or public ownership, or opposing war crimes, even if they differ on this or that. Those seeking transformative policies are now fragmented, but they don\u2019t have to be. The premise of this new initiative is simple: if the left doesn\u2019t band together, the only pressure on Labour will come from the migrant-bashing, rich-worshipping right.\nThe Tories\u2019 chance of winning is infinitesimally small. What matters now is whether anyone who wants to redistribute wealth and power is denied a voice in Starmer\u2019s administration. That is certainly the ambition of his lieutenants. When inevitable disillusionment with a government rooted in deceit and lacking any solutions to Britain\u2019s woes seeps in, it will be the radical right that stands to benefit.\nSo bid me farewell, even cry \u201cgood riddance\u201d, but before you do, ask yourself: what do you think will happen next?\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\nGuardian Newsroom: What is Labour\u2019s plan?

Last weekend, a remarkable democratic experiment reached its first conclusion. A process that began here in South Devon and is now spreading to other constituencies has allowed voters to reclaim the initiative from centralised and self-interested political parties. It directly confronts our unfair electoral system.\nOurs is one of many constituencies in the UK known as \u201cprogressive tragedies\u201d: places in which most people vote for parties to the left of the Tories but which, thanks to our iniquitous first-past-the-post system, end up with Tory representatives. The Conservatives have ruled here since 1924, often without majority support.\nThe Labour and Conservative leaderships conspire to sustain this system, in the hope of absolute majorities. But it works, like other such truncations of democracy (think of our political funding arrangements) much better for the Conservatives than it does for Labour. As Neal Lawson of the democracy campaign Compass argues, of the 11 general elections since 1979, \u201ceight were won by the Conservative party and only three by Labour. But cooperation among progressive parties could have averted all eight Conservative majority governments bar 2015.\u201d\nBoth within the Labour party and in the country at large, there\u2019s an urgent desire for a fairer system. Unfortunately, this desire is thwarted by the Labour leadership. The result? As Lawson points out, of the 15 wealthy nations surveyed by the ParlGov project, voters in the UK are the most left-leaning, yet suffer the most rightwing governments. Sometimes it seems that Labour strategists would rather possess control than power.\nThis is not going to change in the near future. All pleas to work for the greater good, even when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, have been met with stony refusal. As someone well-placed in the party told me, our undemocratic system, and the prospect it offers of gaining an absolute majority, \u201cis like the ring in Lord of the Rings. You know it harms you, but once it\u2019s within your grasp, you can\u2019t give it up.\u201d\nThe simple and brilliant idea of a group of people in the South Devon constituency was to take these decisions out of the hands of the parties and return them to the people. The UK\u2019s first \u201cpeople\u2019s primary\u201d involved seven meetings held around the constituency. Candidates for progressive or vaguely progressive parties were invited to explain to voters why they would be best placed to evict the Conservative. After each meeting, constituents voted by secret ballot to choose their champion. When the aggregate result was announced, everyone in the constituency could see who other people believed was the most promising challenger.\nWithout this help, we have to guess other people\u2019s voting intentions, and we often guess wrong. The people\u2019s primary overcomes the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, ensuring we are less likely to waste our vote. The decision the constituents make doesn\u2019t prevent the other parties from standing. But, by selecting a common champion, it reduces the chances of letting the Tory back in.\nLabour, thrown into chaos by the leadership\u2019s attempt to control their choice of candidates, has yet to field a contender, so was unable to participate. The party leadership would have blocked its involvement anyway. Their loss. The Liberal Democrat and Green candidates battled gamely across two weeks of meetings. The Lib Dem, Caroline Voaden, won decisively. So now we know that our best chance of helping to eject the dismal Tory MP is to vote for her.\nI chaired the first of these meetings. Tickets sold out two days after they were issued. The questions were searching and pertinent. Whatever the results at the general election, this is already a victory of sorts: bringing people back into the political process, showing how democracy could become a living proposition, rather than a dry and curling parchment locked behind a portcullis with chains.\nNow the process has begun in five other constituencies, including those represented by Kemi Badenoch and Danny Kruger. The South Devon pioneers have identified 57 progressive tragedies in which the Conservatives are still predicted to win and there is some uncertainty about who the most effective challenger is likely to be. They\u2019ve offered to share their model with these constituencies, but not with those where one progressive contender is clearly ahead of the others. In those cases they recommend a different system: stopthetories.vote.\nAll the big political parties hate these primaries. The Tory response is understandable: they know they can\u2019t survive a fair democratic process in a progressive constituency. Most shocking and self-destructive has been the reaction of Liberal Democrat party managers. After the South Devon process had begun, a letter to candidates from the Lib Dem chair in England instructed them: \u201cUnder no circumstances are you to take part \u2026 any candidate who ignores this instruction, and participates in a primary, risks having their approved status rescinded and the withdrawal of party support and resources.\u201d\nThe letter revealed an almost comical misunderstanding of what the primary process is and how it is conducted. It claimed that the primary could put candidates in breach of election law on both process and expenses. In reality, the process has been closely scrutinised by the Electoral Commission, and applies a long list of safeguarding rules. The spending (which is very small, as the primaries are created and run by volunteers) takes place before the champion is chosen, so, as the Electoral Commission has confirmed, doesn\u2019t eat into the candidates\u2019 capped election budgets. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by such reactions: any process involving a transfer of control, however beneficial, will be fiercely opposed by those who are losing it.\nOut of adversity comes better tactics. The Isle of Wight East constituency, after the refusal of both Labour and the Lib Dems to play, is designing a new process that doesn\u2019t rely on their involvement.\nThe primaries won\u2019t deliver a perfect system. We\u2019ll still be stuck with a centralised and coercive politics, unmatched to the needs of the complex system we call society, based on the illegitimate concepts of presumed consent and remote decision-making. We will properly reclaim that power only when our representative politics are accompanied by participatory and deliberative decision-making.\nBut it\u2019s a start: a small, slow revolution in a country whose people have long been deprived of their democratic rights. Enough of command and control. Enough of tricks and truncations. Enough of lies and evasions.

{"headline": "The left is smeared as the angry mob again and again. In reality, it is the target of political violence", "author": "Andy Beckett", "teaser": "These threats don\u2019t just seek to intimidate leftwing politicians, it makes them seem a risk to voters, too", "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 11.00 CET", "content": "In Britain and other supposedly calm democracies, the ascent of leftwing politicians can arouse unusual fears of violence. Many conservatives and centrists associate the left with mobs, intimidation and revolutionary struggle. For some on the right, leftwing politics of any sort is a kind of violence, with the upsetting of the traditional order that it promises.\nSuch fears are not always groundless. But more often they are exaggerated, sometimes deliberately, in order to smear the left as fanatical and dangerous. In reality, the left always contains plenty of pacifists and other principled opponents of the use of force \u2013 life\u2019s \u201cherbivores\u201d, as the writer Michael Frayn called them in a perceptive 1963 essay.\nInstead, what violence there is around the left, whether rhetorical or real, is often directed the other way, against the left\u2019s own representatives. \u201cShe should be shot,\u201d concluded the Tory mega-donor Frank Hester\u2019s horrible rant against Diane Abbott, who after 37 years as an MP remains one of the best-known socialists in the country.\nHester\u2019s racism and misogyny have rightly received huge condemnation. Yet less attention has been paid to the extremity of what he said he wanted to happen to Abbott, and less still to the effect of such violent fantasies on the left as a whole. Is talk of violence against the left just an expression of conservative anger, nasty but with no serious political consequences, or is it something more?\nProminent British socialists have always received death threats. Tony Benn got them regularly throughout his decades as an MP, particularly in the 1970s and 80s when he seemed about to acquire significant power as a minister or Labour deputy leader. Sometimes the threats were sent to his wife, Caroline. \u201cWe regret that your husband is going to be killed and that you will be a widow, but it is in the public interest,\u201d said one letter in 1975, which claimed to be from a group of businessmen called the Defenders of Private Enterprise.\nWell-known leftwingers have been physically assaulted. In 1981, Ken Livingstone, the then leader of the radical Greater London Council, was grabbed and sprayed in the face with red paint. In 2019, Jeremy Corbyn had an egg smashed on his head by a Brexit supporter. Such incidents have generally been treated by the media as minor, almost meaningless. Yet they form part of an ominous pattern. Shortly after the egg-smashing, a video appeared on Twitter (now X) of British soldiers in Afghanistan using a poster of Corbyn for target practice. In 2017, a man from Cardiff with far-right views, Darren Osborne, drove a rented van into a crowd near a mosque in Corbyn\u2019s constituency, killing one man. Osborne had originally planned to kill the Labour leader himself.\nFor the politicians targeted, this mixture of serious threats, actual attacks and hostile play-acting can be intimidating, anxiety-inducing or just depressing. In his diaries, Benn often tried to brush off the death threats as ridiculous rightwing fantasies. But sometimes he admitted to being deeply unsettled. In 1981, the New Statesman printed a story about an alleged plan to kill him two years earlier, involving the Tory MP and close ally of Margaret Thatcher, Airey Neave, and a former MI6 agent, Lee Tracey. Benn later saw Tracey on an episode of Panorama about the security services, and recorded that he felt as if \u201cI was watching my potential assassin. It was a very strange feeling.\u201d No inquiry into the alleged plot followed.\nBeyond the individual victims, the broader effect of violence against the left, whether real or rhetorical, is to make leftwing politicians seem a risk. If you elect them, and especially if they gain positions of national power, violence may follow, voters are in effect warned. As British politics has become more confrontational since the mid-2010s, a wider range of MP\u2019s have become targets, most horribly the centre-left Labour MP Jo Cox and the Tory MP David Amess. But the left remains a favourite target. Along with Abbott, one of those in parliament receiving the most violent abuse is the young leftwinger Zarah Sultana.\nAs much as it\u2019s possible to identify the perpetrators in an era of easily anonymised social media, most of the threats appear to come from the political fringes. Yet the main beneficiaries of this climate of fear may turn out to be centrist, relatively bland and therefore less provocative politicians \u2013 however much they themselves may genuinely be appalled by political violence.\nThis is a country where many voters and political journalists revere \u201cmoderates\u201d and dislike \u201cextremists\u201d, especially those on the left. It can be argued that the threat of violence against radical MPs acts as another form of political discipline, keeping rebellious figures such as Abbott isolated and on the margins, where only the bravest fellow MPs are prepared to join them.\nBritain\u2019s self-image as a peaceful place, however much violence it has visited on other countries, and however much violence is in its own history, means that the role of violence in its politics is usually played down. To look into threats against leftwing MPs, like showing an interest in the threats to our democracy from rightwing authoritarians in the 70s and more recently, is to risk being seen as paranoid, ghoulish, a bit obsessive.\nYet as the Hester episode shows, violent sentiments can be expressed by people very close to power, seemingly without serious consequences for their political and commercial activities. Meanwhile, peaceful protesters are increasingly sent to prison. Where a country draws the line between acceptable and unacceptable politics is always very telling.\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Neglected, derided and exploited more than ever: why won\u2019t the UK protect those who rent a home?", "author": "John Harris", "teaser": "Millions face a perfect storm of rising demand, limited supply and politicians who don\u2019t really care enough to ease their plight ", "published": "Sun 24 Mar 2024 13.55 CET", "content": "Last week, a news story broke about the sheer impossibility of everyday living for millions of people all over the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average monthly rent paid by private tenants rose by 9% in the year to February, which is the largest annual increase since records began nine years ago. The average monthly rent in England is now \u00a31,276 and \u00a3944 in Scotland. If you are unfortunate enough to be renting from a landlord in London, your monthly outgoings may well appear hopelessly unrealistic: there, average monthly rents have risen by 10.6%, to a truly eye-watering \u00a32,035. Given that the median UK monthly wage currently sits at about \u00a32,200, the dire affordability crisis all this points to is glaringly clear.\nEverything, moreover, is woven through with a very British sense of the market\u2019s base cruelty: late last year, an investigation by the Observer found that the rents paid by tenants in the wealthiest parts of Britain had gone up by an average of 29% since 2019, whereas for people living in the most deprived areas, the figure was a mind-boggling 52%.\nIn our cities, skyrocketing rents are partly a subplot of the pandemic and its long tail: younger people either continued to live with their parents or moved back home during lockdowns, but are now returning to independent living en masse, thereby causing a spike in demand. At the same time, a crazy rental market and the impossibility of buying somewhere to live seem to be convincing existing tenants to stay put, meaning that supply is being choked off. The result \u2013 which is also playing out in the suburbs \u2013 is a vicious circle, exacerbated by thousands of landlords and letting agencies shoving up rents for both new and existing tenants, simply because they can.\nThe picture in more rural areas may be even more extreme. In 2023, one study claimed that private rents in the English countryside had gone up by an average of 27% in a single year. Again, the pandemic is relevant here: many out-of-town housing markets started to drastically change when families joined the great Covid migration out of urban places. The rampant conversion of homes into Airbnb-type holiday lets has only worsened the resulting pressures. In these places, one of the most obvious results is a quiet epidemic of rural homelessness, reportedly up 40% since 2018.\nAll told, whole swathes of our housing arrangements are in a state of flux, and with social housing still marginalised and property ownership off limits for millions of people, a private-rented sector that cannot cope with the resulting situation has long since turned dysfunctional. In England and Wales, around 5m households now live in private rented housing, up from less than 2m 25 years ago. Age-wise, the proportion of people who are tenants peaks at around 30% among 25- to 34-year-olds, although the number of people over 65 in such housing is reckoned to have increased by about 55% over the past decade. But the share of the national conversation given over to this part of housing policy is still pitifully small: the result, perhaps, of the stupid idea that renting is either something you do in your 20s, or the shameful last resort of older people who are down on their luck.\nThe old Tory vision of the property-owning democracy might be a nice idea, but it has long distorted and misdirected the politics of housing. If people in power fixate on the kind of homes that are bought and sold, the rental sector tends to look not like a part of the social fabric that needs to be reformed and improved, but something people should simply be encouraged to leave. Meanwhile, everything is further distorted by a plain fact that tends to go unmentioned. According to the campaign group 38 Degrees, nearly one in five Tory MPs are also private landlords, something else that makes our politics look almost Dickensian.\nThe sense of almost Victorian neglect is only heightened by how much these issues intersect with poverty. Around 1.9m households in the private rented sector receive an element of universal credit based on the so-called local housing allowance (LHA), which is meant to cover the cheapest third of rents in any given area. LHA was frozen in 2020, leaving rents to soar away from what people could afford. Late last year, Jeremy Hunt used his autumn statement to belatedly announce that it will rise, by an average of around 17%. But that does not solve any of the fundamental problems, for two obvious reasons. First, unless the LHA is uprated every year, it will inevitably fall behind increases in rents. Second, research suggests that even increased local LHA rates will not cover the asking rents for anything like the share of rental properties the government suggests: according to the property consultancy Savills, just 8.5% of such housing will actually be affordable for the relevant people.\nWhat a mess this all this. Nearly a quarter of private rented sector homes are still estimated to fail the decent homes standard. Arbitrary evictions seem to be soaring beyond control. The government\u2019s milquetoast renters reform bill, which was at least meant to outlaw that practice, has reportedly been waylaid by Tory interventions about \u201cthe rights of landlords\u201d, and may not make it through parliament before the election. In Scotland, the end of emergency rent caps and eviction protections for private renters at the end of March is forecast to cause huge problems: housing campaigners say they are already seeing cases of tenants being served with notice of rent increases of as much as 60%. The Labour party, in theory at least, has come up with a renters charter with solid and enduring protections for tenants, and plans to improve the standards of rented properties. There again, when Keir Starmer was asked last week if he supported the London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s drive to introduce modest rent controls, he gave a very characteristic answer: \u201cThat\u2019s not our national policy.\u201d\nAnd so here we are. We all know the essential nature of the contemporary British condition: that unending sense that nothing is reliable, even as we are told to shell out more and more money. The crisis in private rented housing might be the most grimly perfect example to date: the cost of one of life\u2019s most basic essentials endlessly going up, while the people who have to pay get no corresponding increase in everyday security and stability. These are the kind of things that eat away at what used to be called the social contract. If they are not fixed, the anger and resentment that has recently washed through our politics may only be the start.\n John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "In defying Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu is exposing the limits of US power", "author": "Jonathan Freedland", "teaser": "The Israeli PM\u2019s refusal to heed US demands on food aid for Gaza is morally indefensible, hurting the president \u2013  and opening the door to Donald Trump", "published": "Fri 22 Mar 2024 18.41 CET", "content": "The pictures out of Gaza get more harrowing with each passing day. After months of witnessing civilians grieving for loved ones killed by bombs, now we see children desperate to eat \u2013 victims of what the aid agencies and experts are united in calling an imminent \u201cman-made\u201d famine. What matters most about these images is their depiction of a continuing horror inflicted on the people of Gaza. But they also reveal something that could have lasting implications for Israelis and Palestinians, for Americans and for the entire world. What they show, indeed what they advertise, is the weakness of the president of the United States.\nJoe Biden and his most senior lieutenants have been urging Israel to increase the flow of food aid into Gaza for months, in ever more insistent terms. This week the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, cited the finding of a UN-backed agency that the threat of hunger now confronted \u201c100% of the population of Gaza\u201d, adding that this was the first time that body had issued such a warning. Earlier this month, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, told Israel it needed to do whatever it took to get humanitarian aid into Gaza: \u201cNo excuses.\u201d The Biden administration is all but banging the table and demanding Israel act.\nA week ago, it seemed to have had an effect. The Israel Defense Forces announced what was billed as a \u201cdramatic pivot\u201d, promising that it would \u201cflood\u201d Gaza with food supplies. But there\u2019s precious little sign of it. An additional crossing has been opened, the so-called 96th gate, allowing a few more trucks to go in, but nothing on the scale that is required to avert disaster \u2013 or mitigate the disaster already unfolding. For all the talk of a pivot, there is still \u201ca series of impediments, blockages, restrictions \u2026 on lorries carrying the most basic humanitarian aid\u201d, David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee said this week. He noted the way that Israel\u2019s ban on \u201cdual use\u201d items, those things that could be used as weapons if they fell into the hands of Hamas, means that even the inclusion of a simple pair of scissors for a clinic can result in an entire truckful of aid being turned back.\nTo repeat, the victims of this are the 2.2 million people of Gaza, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from. But it represents a severe problem, or several, for Biden too. The most obvious is that he is in a re-election year, seeking to reassemble the coalition that brought him victory in 2020. Back then, a crucial constituency was the young, with voters under 30 favouring Biden over Donald Trump by 25 points. Now it\u2019s a dead heat. To be sure, there are several factors to explain that shift, but one of them is younger Americans\u2019 outrage at the plight of Gaza.\nThe threat to re-election is illustrated most sharply in the battleground state of Michigan, home to 200,000 Arab-Americans who are similarly appalled, with many unequivocal that they will not vote for Biden, even if that risks the return of Trump \u2013 with all that implies for the US and the world. That number is more than enough to tip the state from Democrat to Republican in November. \u201cIf the election were held tomorrow, I think Biden would lose Michigan,\u201d veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told me on the Unholy podcast this week. For Biden, \u201cthis is a pain point\u201d.\nUS support for Israel in this context would be a headache for any Democratic president, but Israel\u2019s willingness to defy its most important ally presses especially on Biden. For one thing, the upside of his great age is supposed to be his experience in foreign affairs and especially his personal relationships with fellow world leaders. He likes to say he has known every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir and that he\u2019s dealt with Netanyahu for decades. Critics reply: a fat lot of good it\u2019s done you.\nAnd that is the heart of the matter. For most of Israel\u2019s history, it\u2019s been taken as read that a clear objection from a US president is enough to make an Israeli prime minister change course. A shake of the head from Dwight Eisenhower brought an end to the Suez war of 1956. A phone call from Ronald Reagan ended the Israeli bombardment of west Beirut in 1982. In 1991, George HW Bush pushed a reluctant Likud prime minister to attend the Madrid peace conference, by withholding $10bn in loan guarantees.\nBiden has repeatedly made his displeasure known, and yet Netanyahu does not budge. It\u2019s making the US look weak and for Biden especially, that\u2019s deadly. \u201cThe subtext of the whole Republican campaign is that the world\u2019s out of control and Biden\u2019s not in command,\u201d David Axelrod, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, told me on Unholy . \u201cThat\u2019s basically their argument, and they use age as a surrogate for weakness.\u201d Every time Netanyahu seems to be \u201cpunking\u201d Biden, says Axelrod, it makes things worse.\nPlenty of Israeli analysts suggest that appearances are deceptive. In their view, Netanyahu is making a great show of thumbing his nose at Biden, because he is in an undeclared election campaign and defiance of Washington plays well with his base, but in reality he is much more compliant. In this reading, Team Netanyahu\u2019s talk of a ground operation in Rafah \u2013 where nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are crammed together, most having fled Israeli bombardment \u2013 is just talk. Yes, the Israeli PM likes to threaten a Rafah invasion, to put pressure on Hamas and to have a bargaining chip with the Americans, but he is hardly acting like a man committed to doing it. Amos Harel, much-respected defence analyst for the Haaretz newspaper, notes that there are only three and a half IDF brigades currently in Gaza, compared with 28 at the height of hostilities. \u201cNetanyahu is in a campaign, and for the time being at least, \u2018Rafah\u2019 is just a slogan,\u201d he told me.\nLet\u2019s hope that\u2019s right, and a Rafah operation is more rhetorical than real. That does not address Israel\u2019s foot-dragging on aid, which Netanyahu is clearly in no hurry to end, in part because his ultranationalist coalition partners believe sending food to Gaza is tantamount to aiding the Hamas enemy.\nThat leaves Biden with two options. His preferred outcome is a breakthrough in the talks in Qatar, which would see both a release of some of the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October and a pause in fighting, allowing aid to flow in. But Netanyahu fears such a pause, which would hasten the day of reckoning for his role in leaving Israel\u2019s southern communities so badly exposed six months ago to Hamas \u2013 whether that reckoning is at the hands of the electorate or a commission of inquiry. He prefers to play for time, ideally until November, when Netanyahu hopes to say goodbye to Biden and welcome back Trump.\nThe alternative for Biden is tougher. Last month, he issued a new protocol, demanding those countries that receive US arms affirm in writing that they abide by international law, including on humanitarian aid. If the US doesn\u2019t certify that declaration, all arms sales stop immediately. In Israel\u2019s case, the deadline for certification is Sunday.\nJoe Biden does not want to be the man who stopped arming Israel, not least because that would leave the country vulnerable to the mighty arsenal of Hezbollah just across the northern border with Lebanon. His administration is split on the move and he may well deem it too much. But he does need to see food flood into Gaza, right away. He has tried asking Netanyahu nicely. Now he needs to get tough.\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "As brutal war rages and famine looms, look at pictures of Gaza and keep saying: \u2018this is not normal\u2019", "author": "Nesrine Malik", "teaser": "Of all the threats to those suffering, one of the most frightening is that we tire \u2013 and their plight becomes background noise", "published": "Mon 25 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "Cast your mind back to early 2022, more than two years ago now. Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was such a shock, such a break with decades of political consensus, that it was treated as an act of aggression that could not for one moment be accepted or made peace with, only urgently rebuffed. Condemnations, lamentations and pledges of support, both for Ukraine\u2019s military effort and its displaced people, all signified the same thing \u2013 this was an aberration that would not be allowed to pass.\nBut pass it did. Russia has since suffered heavy losses and the war is referred to now as a \u201cquagmire\u201d for Putin, but pass it did. US arms support is dwindling, and a sizeable aid package has been stuck, blocked by partisan mischief, in the House of Representatives for months now. Just as striking is how the invasion has become relegated from high news and politics to another item jostling for attention, sympathy and outrage. An obscene banality of war is that if it goes on long enough, life will rearrange around it.\nNow imagine an act of aggression that had no such universal, full-throated condemnation, no pledges of large aid packages and no support or schemes for refugees. In fact, imagine one where the aid and military support is being provided, but it is to the party that is killing civilians and invading their territory. How much harder is it then, to maintain that sense of urgency and outrage? To keep it in the headlines? To keep the pressure up on politicians? To keep it even alive in your heart? It has been almost six months since Israel launched its assault in Gaza. But even as the images of dead children buried in rubble give way to those of dead children emaciated from hunger, there is an unmistakable sense of fade.\nSome of that fade is by design. Why would a matter that raises awkward questions for politicians be kept in the spotlight by those same politicians who have either supported Israel\u2019s actions or dragged their feet in condemning them. The result is not just avoidance, but dilution. The scale of the crisis in Gaza is not brought to us from the lecterns of the US president or his spokespeople, the sort of representatives who (still, jarringly) speak about Russian war crimes and how they must not be tolerated or normalised. On the first anniversary of the Ukraine invasion, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, addressed the United Nations security council and said: \u201cDay after day of Russia\u2019s atrocities, it\u2019s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage. But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal. Bucha is not normal. Mariupol is not normal. Irpin is not normal. Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.\u201d\nGaza is not normal, but you won\u2019t hear Blinken pleading that you not become desensitised to it. Instead it will come from human rights organisations, experts, reporters and aid workers who warn that what amounts to \u201cutter annihilation\u201d is not only exceptional, it is beyond description. But their collective efforts, admirable and credible as they are, catch in a bottleneck when they reach the powers that can do anything about them.\nSo the fact that the assault on Gaza has resulted in the \u201cbiggest cohort of paediatric amputees in history\u201d, or that if things remain as they are, Gaza will fall to \u201cthe most intense famine since the second world war\u201d, will not be acted upon by supporters and underwriters \u2013 both practical and moral \u2013 of Israel\u2019s offensive, beyond what are increasingly farcical requests that the Israeli government behave more reasonably. The volume at which such historic horrors are amplified is always artificially set to one that is much quieter than it should be \u2013 which at this point, is nothing short of at maximum.\nThat silencing also smothers and makes harder the work of those members of the general public who have, for months now, through protest and campaigning, tried to keep that volume as high as it can be; to simply state that this is not normal. But not only is their message being ignored, it is being actively suppressed through attempts to ban protest altogether, or imply relentlessly that it is about something else \u2013 anything else, rather than anger and worry about the fate of those in Gaza. An almost eerie outcome is that as hundreds of thousands pound the streets around the world on a weekly basis and tell their representatives how they feel, their voices are muted, or others speak for them; they become ventriloquist dummies for politicians who present them as parodies of threat and menace.\nThen there is just the fatigue. Fatigue from anger, from being given the run around by politicians, from exposure to events that no human can witness for an extended period of time without some sort of numbing, self-defence impulse kicking in. A double whammy burnout that comes from exposure to scenes and statements, casually posted by Israeli officials or sourced from their own cameras, of unarmed civilians being killed by drone missiles \u2013 but also the silence about them from official parties, even as the footage tears through WhatsApp messages and social media timelines. The problem when unheard-of things happen, is that once they do, they are then heard of.\nBut normalisation also comes from successfully presenting acts of man as acts of God. The more time passes and nothing is done about Gaza, the more it settles in the global conflict pool as something now just too complex (a \u201cquagmire\u201d if you will) to address.

But then I was forced to confront my decades-long resentment", "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 09.00 CET", "content": "\u201cWhy are you fat, and why is she thin,\u201d a puzzled middle-aged man asked, as my identical twin Katy and I strolled into a restaurant in central Mumbai for a post-yoga samosa. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had been asked this question \u2013 but each time it hurt just as much, and stoked a decades-long resentment towards my sister, who was always being told she was better looking than me.\nAs children, we had relished in our identicalness and were joined at the hip. Physically, the only way people (even family members) could tell us apart was by our face shape. I had a slightly rounder face than Katy, with chubby cheeks that earned me the nickname Chipmunk growing up. Katy and I got the same grades, had the same interests, and on birthdays and Christmases got given identical gifts \u2013 but in different colours. We were inextricably \u201cone\u201d.\nBut when we were 13, the cracks began to show. At secondary school we begrudgingly agreed to be separated into different classes, forcing both of us to stand on our own feet for the first time. As the more naive sister, I trusted that our separation would be good for us in time \u2013 that it might help us to forge our own individuality within our closeness. Katy, on the other hand, struggled with her newfound independence.\nIt began with a skipped meal here and there, and an extra walk around the block at lunchtime. After a few months of restrictive dieting and obsessive exercising, Katy had started to lose weight, and a close family member noticed the stark difference in physical appearance between the two of us. Suddenly, we weren\u2019t identical any more.\nOver the next seven years, Katy was in and out of psychiatric units across the country, being treated for anorexia. I expressed my grief through frustrated, teary outbursts where I begged her to \u201cjust eat, like a normal person\u201d. I would visit her after school, at weekends and in the holidays, feeling abandoned, lost and rejected. We refer to this period of our life as the years we \u201chated each other\u201d. I hated the fact I couldn\u2019t live my life as a \u201cnormal\u201d teenager, and she hated how much I hated her.\nAs Katy recovered, our relationship improved. But comments on our physical differences persisted, and they started to affect me. One guy at a party even dared to say to his friend, in earshot: \u201cI\u2019m more attracted to Katy because she\u2019s thinner than Lara.\u201d Our trip to India together had been about trying to repair our fractious bond and embark on yoga teacher training together \u2013 but the comments followed us there, too.\nI realised all the resentment I had been carrying for the past seven years was starting to express itself in a self-destructive and toxic way. I had started to hate myself. I felt less than, invisible, and defeated by my sister\u2019s illness; as if I could never just be enough the way I am. I entertained fantasies that she would always be the more attractive, thinner twin that everyone rallied around. My self-worth had evaporated and I started to lose weight. For two years, we became competitors.\nBut when our dad died three years ago, it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I realised that life was too short to keep comparing myself with my sister, and tying my identity and self-worth to our identicalness.\nI read self-help books religiously to try to improve my body image and self-esteem, like Health at Every Size and Women Don\u2019t Owe you Pretty. I listened to podcasts like Seems Like Diet Culture and ritualised cringe-worthy daily affirmations that I performed in the mirror.\nNow, when people comment on our differences, the result is night and day. Sometimes I still feel insecure, but there are more liberating moments, too, when I think, \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with being bigger than my twin sister, anyway?\u201d It was only when I stopped feeling like the victim of other people\u2019s judgments \u2013 which are ultimately out of my control \u2013 that I finally stopped comparing my weight, size and perceived attractiveness with my twin sister. In doing so, I was able to regain the self-confidence I once had, and finally allow our twinship to truly thrive.\nLara Rodwell is a freelance journalist and author\nIn the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

{"headline": "I\u2019m an Orthodox female rabbi, but I\u2019ve had to leave my unwelcoming synagogue behind", "author": "Nomi Kaltmann", "teaser": "An outdated approach to women and children keeps me from my place of worship. Without more openness, it has no future", "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 16.22 CET", "content": "I vividly recall the moment I made the decision to stop attending synagogue. It happened in 2023, a few months after welcoming my fourth child.\nMy husband and I had managed to get our children dressed and out of the door that Saturday morning \u2013 a feat any parent with small children will recognise, and we arrived in time for the synagogue\u2019s children\u2019s service, a segment lasting about 30 minutes of the larger 2.5-hour service. But our plans were quickly derailed. The children\u2019s programme concluded earlier than anticipated and the playroom was closed, under instructions from the management.\nI felt trapped. I knew that my young children would inevitably make noise, attracting disapproval from older men in the main sanctuary. Determined to find a resolution, I approached a synagogue rabbi and requested that, for that week, he would allow the play area to remain open. He agreed and I breathed a sigh of relief.\nBut a week later, the president of the synagogue called to reprimand me for being rude and demanding. Wow, I thought, frustration surging within me. I had reached my limit. If advocating for a space for children to play, allowing them to actively participate in synagogue, is deemed demanding, then I want no part in it, I thought.\nThe exchange strikes me as an accurate example of the outdated approach of too many synagogues that do not take women and children\u2019s needs into account. Although some are making efforts to improve their amenities, many older ones still have outdated facilities that overlook the necessity for adaptable spaces capable of accommodating noise, children and their caregivers.\nSome buildings lack ramps for people with disabilities or accessibility for those that require it. Breastfeeding mothers often have no access to private space to nurse their children. Instead of embracing the lively sounds of young children, indicative of continuity and a growing community, elderly men persistently shush any children who make noise. Many women I know, especially those with one or two children, have simply stopped attending because the conditions make it impossible.\nIn Orthodox Judaism, the practice of separate seating places the ladies\u2019 gallery out of sight, contributing to women feeling like mere spectators, a concern frequently overlooked by those leading the services. Hardly any Orthodox synagogues have women in leadership, and even fewer have female presidents.\nEven with awareness of these limitations, for many years, my desire to attend synagogue each week persisted. To me, showing up represented a form of leadership. Indeed, in mid-2023 I achieved a significant milestone as one of the world\u2019s first Orthodox female rabbis. While women are unable to hold leadership positions in the synagogue, I am able to teach Torah, answer questions about Jewish law and provide pastoral support on matters of faith and tradition.\nBut, despite progress in some areas, it is clear that there is still a hostility towards women, children and their needs. Synagogues, like many other religious places of worship in the 21st century, are grappling with membership challenges. A significant number of them face the issue of ageing congregations, with entire generations of young people, unlike their parents and grandparents, showing little inclination to purchase memberships. Some synagogues have had to sell their buildings, other congregations have merged and many are desperate to fill their pews on a weekly basis.\nI live in Melbourne but this is a global problem, and a quick peek into any synagogue in most places will show you that they have rows of seats to fill. But I\u2019m not sure how synagogue leaders anticipate filling the pews if they are intolerant to the joyous noise of children \u2013 the next generation of potential members.\nWhile many communities like to hold roundtable conversations about why young Jews are no longer going to synagogue or considering buying memberships, I can tell you first-hand that there is not a lot of introspection about how they treat the women and youngest Jews who come through their doors.\nSometimes my husband still goes to synagogue with the kids, but I choose to sit it out. Other times, I take my children to the park or attend a more informal, ad-hoc service outside a synagogue with my friends.\nMy generation of young Jews envisions a dynamic Judaism that isn\u2019t tethered to a physical building but understands the need for synagogues to adapt if they are to survive. Owning expensive properties and buildings isn\u2019t enough; leaders must take thoughtful measures to make both inhabitants and guests feel welcome, especially women and children. Synagogues and their management have a lot more work to do to meet 21st-century standards.\nNomi Kaltmann is an Orthodox female rabbi and the Australian correspondent at Tablet Magazine (NYC)"},

I turned this over in my head as I scanned the passenger seat of my car, piled high with takeaway containers of chicken wings. Being overfull was a familiar feeling in my work as a food critic. That crisp October day, the question was also existential \u2013 I had simply reached the end of the road.\nI\u2019d been thrilled to land my job nearly six years earlier at a newspaper covering the 3 million people and 10,000+ restaurants of New York City\u2019s eastern suburbs. I\u2019d grown up on Long Island reading Newsday, an award-winning powerhouse in the 80s and 90s, and years later had returned home for a job I initially loved. Driving hundreds of miles a week, I sometimes ate out four or five times a day as I pursued stories. Ribeye, oysters, cumin lamb, birria tacos \u2013 much of it went on my corporate credit card. The hustle was constant but the reward was unearthing under-the-radar places, dishes and people. I also wrote about wine, beer, coffee, and cocktails, which meant rubbing elbows with talented brewers and bartenders.\nWhenever someone asked what I did for a living, their eyes lit up at the response. \u201cI\u2019m a food writer,\u201d I\u2019d say, deliberately avoiding the word \u201ccritic\u201d, which sounded pompous and was actually my least favourite part of writing about food. \u201cStop. You get paid to eat? What a hard life! You have my dream job,\u201d they would invariably say.\nFrom the outside, it was a dream, and complaining seemed ungracious. So, I rarely told anyone that the work was not for the faint of heart. Literally. I lurched from plate to plate, deadline to deadline, postponing medical appointments and taking work on \u201cvacation\u201d so often that it became a running joke among friends. On the odd occasion I made it to the doctor, my blood levels told an ominous story. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that number a little lower,\u201d said my doctor as she studied my soaring cholesterol. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t control what I eat,\u201d I told her.\nDuring the pandemic, eaters pivoted hard toward lasagna, fried-chicken sandwiches, mac and cheese, and cocktails to go. In turn, our team pivoted from reviews to review-esque listicles. Reporting these entailed calorific culinary surveys. Some food writers I knew had honed the art of taking one bite of everything; if I really loved a dish, I\u2019d eat more, and maybe even finish it off. I watched my weight tick upward, and workouts and daily walks had minimal effect.The occasional bout of food poisoning was a job hazard, yet it was long-term overconsumption that took the real toll.\n\u201cDid we try Lipitor?\u201d My doctor squinted at the screen. \u201cOh, yeah, we did. What was the problem again?\u201d \u201cMade my legs hurt,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhat about Livalo?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy insurance won\u2019t cover it,\u201d I told her. \u201cWell, take it easy,\u201d she warned. \u201cBecause it looks like you\u2019re also pre-diabetic.\u201d\nI processed this news while tucking into fish tacos down the street. I couldn\u2019t just not eat the tacos, or pappardelle, or Korean fried chicken, could I?\nThat may have marked the beginning of the end. Or maybe there were a few endings in succession \u2013 from the pseudo-vacations and listicle fatigue to a heart arrhythmia that required an ablation. Two days after the procedure, as I recuperated at home covered in welts, an editor texted me about a story revision.\nI hung on for another year but began to daydream about cooking at home more than one or two nights a week, about burrowing out from under infinite leftovers. It was six orders of wings in a single afternoon that finally did me in. From the front seat of my car \u2013 which doubled as an office, table, and photo studio \u2013 I wet-wiped sweet-chilli sauce from my fingers and requested a Zoom call with my boss.\n\u201cMy time at the paper has come to an end,\u201d I told her. She leaned forward. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI was. Afterwards, I felt wobbly but buoyant, as if I had instantly dropped an enormous weight. I also wondered if I\u2019d done something phenomenally stupid. Media colleagues were losing their jobs at a steady clip, and I recalled the sting of being laid off from prior positions. My journalist\u2019s savings account was less than robust.\nI didn\u2019t have much time to ruminate, as my story was due soon. Inside the next place, I took a seat at the bar, as I often did when eating alone, and ordered the wings scarpariello-style. Lacquered in a zingy vinegar sauce, they were excellent. I sampled a few while watching football on the bar TV along with the cooks, who were awaiting the dinner rush. The pandemic-era plexiglass separators were gone, and the place had reclaimed a long-absent airiness. It was the kind of detail that wouldn\u2019t make it into an SEO-optimised listicle.\nIt would take a few months to retrain the colossal appetite my body had become accustomed to, but I hoped that, down the road, those months would earn me a few extra years. I miss my colleagues and a regular paycheck \u2014 entrepreneurial life can be a roller coaster \u2014 but 15 months on, I\u2019ve reversed the weight gain, lowered my cholesterol without meds, and I\u2019m no longer pre-diabetic. The most unexpected shift, though, is the reverse-aging power of stress reduction. \u201cYou look so different,\u201d more than one friend has said. \u201cYou just look\u2026.relaxed.\u201d\nCorin Hirsch is a writer who covers food, drink, and travel\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "If Tories who want to run the capital think London is in New York, shouldn\u2019t we be worried?", "author": "Marina Hyde", "teaser": "It was crazy to flag up UK crime using footage of the NY subway. But then, Susan Hall is the candidate: wisdom\u2019s in short supply", "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 15.23 CET", "content": "So sad to see the Conservative party talking down Britain in its new attack ad for the London mayoral elections, which \u2013 among other deliberate and unethical lies \u2013 included footage of commuters fleeing false reports of gunfire in New York\u2019s Penn station in 2017. That bit has now been edited out, but what remains of the ad purports to be a 90-second portrait of life in the capital since London mayor Sadiq Khan \u201cseized power\u201d. Given that Khan has twice won the London mayoralty in free and fair votes, this feels somewhat punchy talk from a party led by an unelected man who himself \u201cseized power\u201d from the salad-vanquished political corpse of an unelected woman.\nBut look, what\u2019s the worst that can happen if political parties tell blatant untruths to people, debase campaigning standards and conduct knowing assaults on trust? If only there were places in the world to which we could point in order to answer that question.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this advert, it\u2019s a grainy black-and-white montage supposedly showing life in \u201ca crime capital of the world\u201d (London). Apart from all the obviously disprovable fakery and dishonest manipulations and misrepresentations that we\u2019ll come to in a minute, the entire ad is inexplicably voiced by an actor doing a bad American accent. Why? He doesn\u2019t even go here. And yes \u2013 I get that on the one hand, this opens me up to the possibility of the actor who voiced the ad identifying himself and crossly declaring himself to be an actual American, perhaps hailing from one of the regions where they have unconvincing American accents.\nOn the other hand, this course of action would involve him identifying himself as the person who voiced this embarrassing ad, so \u2026 I\u2019m feeling relatively safe. Indeed, given I live in London I am feeling relatively safe anyway, what with the Crime Survey for England and Wales reporting that residents of the capital are less likely to be victims of crime than across the country as a whole.\nAnyway: the ad. Suffice to say that every creative decision taken on the script seems to have been signed off by a beta version of ChatGPT or someone who has suffered a recent head trauma. Sample writing: \u201cGripped by the tendrils of rising crime, London\u2019s citizens stay inside \u2026 the metropolis teetering on the brink of chaos.\u201d\n\u201cIn the depths of these narrow passageways,\u201d growls the unconvincing American, \u201ctread squads of Ulez enforcers, dressed in black, faces covered with masks, terrorising communities.\u201d Mm. But do they?\nOf similar concern is the decision to use a scare graph that, upon closer inspection, appears to resemble a graph showing crime in England and Wales significantly overtaking crime in London. But hey, it\u2019s a graph, it looks the part, it\u2019s got two lines crossing in a way that looks the right stripe of worrying.\nThe wider purpose of the ad is an attempt to cast London as a Gotham desperately in need of a Batman. Off the back of that statement, can I bring myself to type the words \u201cEnter Susan Hall\u201d? Yes I think I can, just for the mirthless laugh. Enter Susan Hall. If you\u2019re not familiar with Susan, she\u2019s the Conservative candidate running against Khan, and is arguably the final form in a long series of Tory mayoral hopefuls of whom the only question that can ever be asked is, \u201cOh wow \u2013 where on earth did they find that one?\u201d\nWhere DID they find Susan? Possibly on account of her lurid social media history, she\u2019s been described as a populist, and for much of her time since selection has come off as the best kind of populist \u2013 one who is not very popular. Having said that, the picture has distinctly shifted in recent months, and noises from the Labour campaign are increasingly strangulated. There is at least a small possibility that Hall could win \u2013 which would ironically be one of the most compelling arguments that London is having some form of existential crisis.\nNone of which is to suggest that Khan is the most exceptional of rivals. For my money he has been a very indifferent mayor, and anyone seeking a third term should be expected to be judged and attacked on their record. But the fact that he isn\u2019t, in ads like this, does matter. It does matter if parties fake scenes of terror in a London Underground station that turns out to be in New York. It does matter if untruths are told because it\u2019s easier than fighting truthfully. And \u2013 as discussed here previously \u2013 it matters when the other side do it too. It mattered when Keir Starmer decided to release an attack ad featuring a picture of a grinning Rishi Sunak and the slogan: \u201cDo you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nAll of these things matter and don\u2019t result in anything good. We already know where assaults on truth lead, because we\u2019ve seen them happen in other countries and in some cases our own, and people on all sides have spent a lot of the past decade lamenting it. The tragedy is that we all know it, and even the people who come up with the ads know it \u2013 but they\u2019re still doing it because they think that it works in the very short term. Yet in the long term, it really, really doesn\u2019t \u2013 which makes doing it anyway pretty criminal in itself.\nMarina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "The collapse of Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks is a death knell for industrial, working-class Britain", "author": "Keith Gildart", "teaser": "UK industrial towns offered not only well-paid jobs, but a whole culture. A radical alternative is desperately needed", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 14.37 CET", "content": "Last week, Tata Steel in Port Talbot announced the immediate closure of its coke ovens. These ovens create the coke that ultimately powers the blast furnaces, which, as was announced in January, are due to be shut down. The decision by Tata to close the furnaces sent shock waves through the community. There are set to be 2,800 job losses \u2013 a huge blow for a small town that has already undergone significant cuts to its steel industry over the past decades. A final chapter in the decades-long deindustrialisation of the British economy appears to be coming to a close.\nPlant closures are never only about the loss of work, but also the cultural and psychological effects on the people who are made unemployed, on families and communities. Steel provided well-paid, unionised and skilled employment, and created a working-class culture that gave the country Labour MPs, athletes, musicians, writers, artists and a sense of community and collective purpose. Port Talbot even gave the world the cinematic presence of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins.\nSuch a distinct, collectivist culture was crucial to the development of Wales, central Scotland and parts of England in the 19th and 20th centuries. At its peak in the 1960s, Port Talbot steelworks employed about 18,000 workers, complemented by the nearly 60,000 employed in south Wales coalmines. These industries after the second world war offered an alternative vision of industrial relations, investment, community development, and a Wales (and Britain) with working-class agency at its centre.\nThe seeds of the destruction of this world of labour were planted with the mass closures of coalmines in the late 1950s and then the 1960s, with patchy attempts by governments to mitigate the effects. But the election of a Labour government in 1974 granted a temporary reprieve to the steel and coal industries. The subsequent Plan for Coal envisaged a long-term future for the industry with the introduction of new technology, skills and high wages. In these years, a miner could become an engineer, a mine manager, an official of the National Coal Board, a trade union official or a Labour MP. Others could take advantage of the education provided by the National Union of Mineworkers and enter university. Having started work as a coalminer in 1985, I took this path in 1992, studying history and politics and eventually became a university professor. Yet with the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, a darkness descended over the steel and coal communities.\nThe warning shot for British Steel and Welsh industry came with the closure of Shotton in March 1980, when 6,500 jobs were axed in a single day. The steel strike of the same year ended in defeat for the steelworkers. By the time Ian MacGregor left his role at British Steel in 1983 to move on to the National Coal Board, he had cut the steel workforce by almost 60% in only three years. After the crushing defeat of the miners in their year-long fight against closures in 1984-85, pits rapidly disappeared from the British landscape. The destruction of communities quickly followed. Both the moderate leadership of the steel unions and the more militant activism of the miners could do nothing to stem the tide of unemployment, inequality, poverty and the transformation of the world of work.\nWhat has the loss of this world ushered in? The impact can be seen not just in Port Talbot but across the post-industrial regions of Wales, England and Scotland. While that industrial world of work brought with it risks to life and health, the income, opportunities and relative security offered stability. That has been replaced by warehousing, logistics, retail parks that offer zero-hours contracts, low wages, no long-term security and hostility to trade union membership and representation. Decades after the closures, Britain\u2019s coalfields are still feeling the long-term effects, suffering disproportionately from multiple inequalities.\nThe deindustrialisation of Britain and the marginalisation of the working class has also had a profound impact on political engagement and representation. Your Labour MP is now likely to be a lawyer, special adviser and expensively educated graduate, rather than a steelworker or a coalminer. Meanwhile, the organised working class has moved further to the periphery of political and civic British life. At the same time, perhaps counterintuitively, the old industrial workforce is viewed with a sense of deference rather than suspicion. Steelworkers and coalminers have gone from being labelled as industrial dinosaurs, technological Luddites and enemies within, to being almost canonised through films such as The Full Monty and Billy Elliot.\nThat is all very well and good, but what is really needed is an appreciation of the communities and the political alternatives that they provided. Post-steel and post-coal localities need a radical industrial policy that would bring high-paid jobs, skills and opportunities that could form the basis of a real driver of levelling up. As the Port Talbot coke ovens close, what is the government doing to fill the void?\nKeith Gildart is a former coalminer, and now a professor of labour and social history at the University of Wolverhampton"},
{"headline": "The poor need the money, the rich may not \u2013 but I say hands off the state pension triple lock", "author": "Owen Jones", "teaser": "The policy has its critics, but as Tories and Labour vow to keep it, I back its retention. It can be made fair, and a state should care for its people", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "A wealthy nation can afford to offer a comfortable and secure existence for all of its citizens. If it chooses not to do so, that is a political choice. If rationality reigned supreme, this would prove the starting point for all decisions about how society is organised. Bad news: it doesn\u2019t, and instead much of the vast riches generated by the graft of millions of workers ends up hoovered into the bank accounts \u2013 and offshore tax havens \u2013 of a tiny few. The result? It\u2019s easy to encourage the general population to believe that they\u2019re locked in trench warfare over ever-scarcer resources, with so little to go around that politics is merely the art of managing a zero-sum game.\nEnter, then, the question of the triple lock on the state pension, which both Tories and Labour have confirmed will feature in their upcoming manifestos. First introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010, it ensures that pensioners\u2019 entitlements increase each April in line with whatever is highest: inflation, the average increase in wages, or a 2.5% minimum. That means more than \u00a3100bn is now splashed on the state pension each year, by far the biggest single item of social security spending, while working-age benefits have fallen drastically behind. When you include other entitlements, well over half of the welfare state ends up in pensioners\u2019 bank accounts. At the same time, more than 60% of older Britons own their home outright, sitting on golden eggs that have only appreciated in value.\nYou can see why Britain has become a petri dish of generational resentment. Since the dawn of the triple lock, our working-age population has suffered the most protracted squeeze in living standards since records began. Younger Britons, in particular, have been devastated by a social tsunami: real-terms cuts to their education, stagnating pay packets, student debts, collapsing homeownership, a rip-off private rented sector, a devastated welfare state \u2013 well, we truly could go on.\nThe resentment only deepens. While older Britons have been gifted with the protections of social democracy, they have consistently voted for their grandchildren to be blasted with the icy chills of \u201csink or swim\u201d capitalism. It is not widely appreciated that, when Labour suffered its 2019 electoral cataclysm, it actually won more votes from the working-age population than the Tories; 57% of Britons in their 60s voted Tory in 2019, for those in their 70s, that figure rose to a staggering 67%. Younger citizens largely saw Brexit as an attack on their futures, a rupture only made possible thanks to grey voters, while much of the so-called culture wars boils down to a backlash among older Britons against the increasingly progressive values of millennials and generation Z.\nBut believing that the woes of the young can be solved by diminishing provision for the old is a grave mistake. More than 2 million pensioners languish beneath the poverty line \u2013 an increase in relative poverty rates compared with a decade ago. In a list comparing incomes against the cost of living in 30 European nations, the British state pension appears at a mediocre number 16. Britain is the sixth-largest economy on Earth, yet even now remains incapable of offering a basic contract: that every Briton should be assured comfort and security in their final years.\nThose who advocate a less generous state pension are unintentionally attacking the young. After all, we are all aspirational pensioners. If our state pension increases at a lesser rate, where will that leave today\u2019s 25-year-old, whenever they\u2019re able to retire? After all, siren voices already advocate hiking it to 71. It is the working class, as ever, who will be punished. On average, the less well-off not only have shorter lifespans than the affluent: they tend to suffer ill health sooner, robbing them of comfortable retirements. They are less likely, of course, to have assets and means to supplement the state pension. Those robbed of security in earlier years will suffer the same fate later on, especially if they have less.\nThere is a predictable retort: what of the 3 million pensioners with household wealth valued at over \u00a31m? Why do they need state pensions at all? This inevitably always takes the conversation to the question of means testing, which is not only expensive and bureaucratic, but leaves many vulnerable citizens failing to claim support they need. As it is, more than a third of families eligible for the means-tested pension credit, for example, do not claim it.\nThe answer here is obvious. The dividing line that really matters is who has wealth, and who does not. Generous universal entitlements are the only proven means of ensuring that all who need support receive it. You can then simply recoup revenue from wealthy pensioners through taxation. Indeed, a detailed study by the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 \u2013 which brought together academics and tax specialists \u2013 found that a one-off wealth tax on millionaire couples paid at 1% a year for half a decade would raise \u00a3260bn. Much of that would come from prosperous pensioners, of course, but also from Britons of any age of substantial means. This vast sum could lift the living standards of all struggling Britons, irrespective of age.\nAnd that\u2019s what matters. Politicians of all parties have left us believing that there simply aren\u2019t the resources to solve our problems. That reduces society to a cauldron of often dangerous resentments, variously encouraging many to believe that our lives would be better if the undeserving would stop hogging meagre services and entitlements: often, the demonised foreigner, or supposedly feckless fellow Brits.\nFor many younger citizens, their worldviews understandably defined by their chronic economic insecurity and inclusive social values, there lurks the spectre of the bigoted, entitled, selfish boomer, whose dreadful electoral choices have robbed them of their futures. It\u2019s an understandably seductive narrative, but offers false solutions that will only hurt them more.\nThis is a rich nation. It suits those with booming fortunes to pretend otherwise, because it would lead to demands that they stop appropriating the nation\u2019s wealth. It suits them well when we squabble among ourselves.\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "Our lack of affordable, safe housing is a national crisis. Here are three things Labour can do to fix it", "author": "Peter Apps", "teaser": "If it gets to No 10, the party should fund a social housing boom, tackle homelessness \u2013 and usher in a post-Grenfell era of safety", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 13.00 CET", "content": "The failures in housing policy over several generations are now all too obvious: rising homelessness, families and key workers priced out of cities and a generation unable to move out of their parents\u2019 homes. The next government needs to take radical action to change this picture, rather than make small tweaks to a failed system. These are some of the steps I would take to get there.\nThe next Labour government must break with the idea that we can no longer afford to build new social rented homes, and instead return to the ideals of the postwar consensus, where housing provision was as much a role for the state as health and education.\nDespite towering war debts, in 1953 the UK\u2019s local authorities built 245,000 social rented homes in a single year, which accounted for 75% of all homes built. Last year, there were a shade over 9,500 social rent homes built in England \u2013 just 4% of all homes built.\nWe are not going to go back to 1950s levels of council housebuilding any time soon, but the contrasting figures should at least illustrate that another way is possible. Even a return to the 40,000 social rented homes built in 2010-11 \u2013 a result of New Labour programmes \u2013 or the 57,000 built under a Conservative government in 1993 would make a major difference. The low numbers in recent years are a historical quirk of the post-2010 austerity era, and Labour should consign them to history.\nThe party should realise that higher levels of investment in social housing are necessary to make its big commitment to new towns work and to navigate the current market downturn. Since there is no point turning on the taps with the plug out, Labour should also scrap the right to buy as part of this drive.\nA report last month calculated that investing in 90,000 social homes would repay within 11 years and would generate a \u00a312bn profit for the taxpayer over 30 years. It is time to understand that government borrowing for this sort of investment is wholly different from borrowing for tax cuts, energy bill relief or banking sector bailouts. If rigid fiscal rules preclude this sort of investment, the rules should change.\nOver the past 14 years, the government\u2019s stated housing objective has been to boost home ownership. The result? A steep rise in house prices.\nMeanwhile, the number of households in temporary accommodation in England has soared to 109,000 \u2013 a rise of almost 120% since 2010. On top of this, rough sleeping has risen by 27% in a year, and the number of families presenting to their council as homeless has grown by almost 30,000 in five years.\nLabour should change the state\u2019s housing policy objective from boosting home ownership to relieving and preventing homelessness \u2013 the most obvious and tragic manifestation of our broken system.\nBy promising to be judged on its ability to reduce rough sleeping, the number of families in temporary accommodation and individuals who present to their local authority as homeless, Labour would mark a vital philosophical shift from which better policy would flow.\nThe quickest lever would be to increase the local housing allowance \u2013 the total benefits that can be claimed for housing costs \u2013 back to pre-austerity levels. This would allow councils to rehouse homeless families more easily and allow those in financial stress to keep a roof over their head.\nBut in the longer term, Labour would need to explore western European private rental models, the defining characteristics of which are some form of rent control and long-term security of tenure. It would also mean adopting housing-first models, where rough sleepers are given a home along with further support, which have all but eliminated rough sleeping in Finland.\nThe shocking scenes in Valencia last month, where 10 people died in a tower fire, are the most stark reminder of the urgent need to make our buildings safe. Nearly seven years on from the Grenfell Tower fire, there are still many thousands of buildings around the UK that have major fire safety defects. The residents of these buildings are unable to move on with their lives and it is only luck that has prevented a repeat disaster.\nWhat should have happened in the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell fire, and what Labour must prioritise in government, is a centralised response from the recently created building safety regulator. The next government should beef up its powers, give it a mandate to oversee the removal of dangerous cladding and repair of other defects and ensure that developers, contractors and cladding suppliers are held to account. Tough action should be taken against those dragging their feet.\nFire safety should simply be the first step in a major push to raise safety and quality standards across the whole housing sector, which must also include stronger rights for renters living in disrepair. We also need tougher oversight of construction sites, strong penalties for those who fail to build safe homes and genuine protections for homebuyers. Otherwise the planned expansion of housebuilding will simply be an expansion of the building safety crisis.\nPeter Apps is the author of Show Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell Happen"},
{"headline": "The Zone of Interest is a portrait of guilt. No wonder it has divided opinion in Germany", "author": "Fatma Aydemir", "teaser": "Most Germans insist their ancestors weren\u2019t Nazis. Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film pries away at the cracks in this narrative", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 08.00 CET", "content": "There is something unsettling about sitting in a German theatre laughing at Nazis. How unsettling depends on the type of humour that prompts the laughter. Is it meant to set the audience apart from the stage action, or does the laughter stem from the discomfort of proximity? When I saw the satire Nachtland staged recently at Berlin\u2019s prestigious Schaub\u00fchne (a production also runs in an English translation at the Young Vic in London until 20 April), I perceived the ripples of laughter filling the room as a sort of embarrassed self-awareness. Like a tense moment of getting caught \u2013 a feeling that every storyteller ultimately longs to evoke.\nIn the play, which has a present-day setting, two siblings find a painting signed by \u201cA. Hitler\u201d in their dead father\u2019s house. Once they realise that the kitschy artwork is worth more than \u20ac100,000 if they can credibly authenticate the artist as Hitler, the siblings start recasting their entire family history in a different light. While the previous narrative had insisted that \u201cour family had nothing to do with the Nazis\u201d (the dominant account in most German households), now suddenly the late grandmother is not only found to be a committed follower of Nazi ideology, but to have had a love affair with Hitler\u2019s secretary. As the new family history pragmatically, and profitably, unfolds, it becomes much more realistic, ironically, than the hitherto official version.\nSurveys have found that most Germans claim their family members did not actively support the Nazis. Ten percent say they don\u2019t know for sure, which could simply mean they never asked. Almost 30% even believe their ancestors were part of the resistance and helped potential victims of Nazi crimes survive or hid them in their own houses. Mathematically, the numbers don\u2019t add up \u2013 if they were accurate, millions of lives could have been saved. But psychologically, this self-perception gives deep insight into how collective remembrance of the Holocaust works for many Germans: There is guilt, but it is externalised. Nazis were always the others, the evil monsters from the History Channel; certainly not Grandpa Hans, who left a remarkable fortune he came into possession of during the early 1940s. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know\u201d is a common phrase you would hear from contemporary witnesses asked about the systematic annihilation of Jews, before this generation started to die.\nThis is the context in which to understand why Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film The Zone of Interest has received mixed reviews from German critics. The film has won international acclaim, honoured by two Oscars, one of them for best international feature film, as well as the Grand Prix in Cannes. But in Germany the film has not drawn universal approval. Glazer\u2019s focus on the idyllic family life of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss and his wife, Hedwig, in their home next to the concentration and extermination camp has been praised by some as the first feature movie to appropriately speak of the unspeakable horror of Auschwitz. Others, however, have said it represents a \u201ctrivialisation of the evil\u201d. The visual absence of camp inmates is especially controversial (we only hear them in the movie and watch the H\u00f6ss family ignoring the horrible sounds coming from the other side of the wall). It is either praised as a stringent examination of German repression, or slated as an \u201cannihilation of antisemitic violence\u201d.\nLeaving aside that provocative wording, it is true that Glazer\u2019s film shows antisemitic violence in just a few scenes, but that does not minimise it \u2013 rather, it underlines it even more effectively. The Nazi family knows what\u2019s going on next door; they approve of it; they are not even conflicted about it. Of course, this is a story about a privileged Nazi commandant who oversaw mass murder, and not your average German family living through the second world war. But in the naturalistic way the characters talk about daily banalities or care for their kids, their garden, their pets and their beautiful house \u2013 the way they don\u2019t have to care about anything outside \u2013 they could be seen to also represent the idealised, self-interested, bourgeois, even aspirational family today. Interestingly, the film doesn\u2019t bother to make the viewer identify with the Nazi family; the camera always observes them from a safe distance. The characters appear schematic, but not in the same way as the perpetrators from other Holocaust films. They resemble, rather, a normal, white, heteronormative German family.\nMight it be triggering to German audiences to watch such familiar domesticity intertwined so closely with the unimaginable crimes next door? Or that there is nothing to laugh or cry about in The Zone of Interest: no catharsis, no relief, just the constant unease of the diffuse horror in the background? The sounds from the camp and the technical conversations about the efficiency of the ovens instantly bring to mind images of Auschwitz. The film presupposes the audience knows about Auschwitz. At least in Germany, of all places, this is an assumption that can be made because of the country\u2019s \u201cremembrance culture\u201d.\nThis Erinnerungskultur, or commitment to face up to the nation\u2019s crimes under nazism, is, according to the social scientist Samuel Salzborn, mainly characterised by official commemoration and private denial, a deep gap between the domestic and the public sphere. The Jewish-German writer Max Czollek describes German memory culture as an effort \u201cto reconcile the Germans with themselves\u201d.\nBut there is no room for reconciliation in The Zone of Interest. While German film productions on the Third Reich made in recent decades tend to stress the potential for acts of resistance even among higher ranking circles of the Wehrmacht, Glazer\u2019s film allows resistance only in the shape of a lonely Polish girl hiding apples in bushes for Auschwitz inmates. It concentrates on looking at the perpetrator. Not with disgust, not with compassion: it just looks. This film is a depiction of guilt. And that, perhaps, is, above all, why it sits uneasily with German audiences. The guilt we see can\u2019t be externalised or historicised: it is ubiquitous and ageless. Its germ cell lies in the aspirations and wealth of the nuclear family; in the pragmatism and self-righteousness that give rise to their complicity in genocide. That the film has divided opinion in Germany only proves how powerful this approach really is.\nFatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based Guardian Europe columnist\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Synthetic opioids have arrived in Britain. As a former drug dealer, I know how the UK should respond", "author": "Niko Vorobyov", "teaser": "There are better ways of tackling addiction and overdoses than reverting to the tactics of a failed drugs war", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 16.24 CET", "content": "Last week the home secretary, James Cleverly, announced that nitazenes are now being treated as class A drugs, his statement bookended with the usual stern rhetoric about the need to keep \u201cthese vile drugs off our streets\u201d. The maximum penalty for selling or supplying class As is life imprisonment.\nCleverly\u2019s decision follows the discovery that several victims of deadly drug poisonings had nitazenes in their system. Nitazenes are synthetic opioids, meaning they are similar to the heroin and morphine refined from opium poppies but made entirely in a lab. First developed as painkillers in the 1950s but never approved for medical use, they have been found mixed into heroin to give the low-grade variety of the drug that extra kick, as well as in bootleg Xanax and Valium pills sold on the dark web. Up to 500 times stronger than morphine, even a tiny amount can prove fatal.\nIn these relatively few instances, there are echoes of the US\u2019s overdose epidemic, which now claimsmore than 100,000 lives a year \u2013 more than half of which are from fentanyl, another synthetic opioid. This outbreak has sparked a revival of tough-on-drugs policies. But if the UK risks sliding towards an opioid crisis, these are the pitfalls we must avoid.\nA month ago, the state of Oregon repealed its Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act (known as Measure 110), which had passed by referendum in 2020, decriminalising personal quantities of narcotics as part of a \u201chealth-based\u201d based approach to drug addiction. Under that law, users weren\u2019t arrested for holding a gram of cocaine, but instead were fined $100 unless they entered into drug treatment services. Dealing, meanwhile, was still classified as a crime. But amid a spiralling death toll from the fentanyl crisis, and homeless people\u2019s tents filling the sidewalks, lawmakers panicked and reversed their decision. Drug users caught with small quantities of drugs may now face prison again.\nThis reversion to the drug-war norm makes little sense \u2013 it has been proved time and time again that greater criminalisation does nothing to lower addiction rates. Politicians lost their nerve in Oregon because of a rise in drug fatalities after Measure 110 was passed \u2013 but as one study showed, this is more to do with the growing prevalence of fentanyl than users taking greater risks because of looser penalties. It is a fact that wherever fentanyl hits the market in the US, the death rate shoots up. Police action disrupting the supply chain only makes matters worse, as new dealers appear with unknown strength and quality. A recent study in Indiana found that fatal overdoses spiked each time there was a major drug bust.\nA growing street homelessness problem \u2013 and the very public drug-taking that many of those on the streets are embroiled in \u2013 also forced the hand of lawmakers. But people don\u2019t pitch up a tent under a bypass because of addiction issues. West Virginia has been among the worst-hit by drug deaths, but boasts the lowest homelessness rate. Why? Housing there is relatively cheap, while average rents in Oregon doubled between 2020 and 2021. Could it be that unaffordable rents are pushing people from their homes? No, it must be the drugs!\nSnapping on the handcuffs doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve tried tramadol, drunk lean (a cocktail of codeine plus soda) and smoked opium, and I get why folks grow addicted to opioids. If your life feels empty and hopeless, why not? They don\u2019t fill the void, but they let you not care. They\u2019re like an anaesthetic for inner pain. One recent study found that 96% of patients leaving mandatory detox relapsed within months, proving that caging people does not cure them of their trauma. You simply can\u2019t force someone into sobriety.\nWhat could Britain do differently? In the 1980s, a Liverpool clinic headed by Welsh doctor John Marks provided free heroin and cocaine courtesy of the NHS. There was no toxic fentanyl or nitazenes, no one dropped dead from an overdose, and the stability of a steady fix gave their patients a chance to live normal lives, holding down jobs and rebuilding bonds with their families without being on edge for policemen or pushers. Their business drying up, heroin dealers began disappearing from the area.\nSo why should law-abiding taxpayers foot the bill for these junkies getting their jollies? Well for a start, it\u2019s more cost-efficient. The cohort of patients at a similar clinic in Middlesborough committed 541 crimes prior to entering the programme, costing \u00a32.1m in taxpayer money. And if they were locked away in prison, it cost another \u00a347,000 a year to keep them housed and fed, again at taxpayers\u2019 expense. Giving them free heroin, on the other hand, costs only \u00a312,000 per year, while giving them a chance to get their life back together. Over a period of six months, the Middlesborough cohort committed a grand total of three crimes, all had found a roof over their heads (many were previously unhoused), and they had stopped buying smack from their dealers (which may have contained toxic additives) almost entirely. That is, until funding was cut in 2022.\nFeeding their dependency wasn\u2019t an ideal solution, but since long-term diamorphine use \u2013 ie clinically pure heroin \u2013 causes minimal damage to the body, certainly less than alcohol, it avoids the absolute worst consequences. You can\u2019t help someone if they\u2019re dead.\nWith the Taliban\u2019s poppy ban cutting off the heroin supply from Afghanistan, it\u2019s likely that synthetic opioids will become more common on Britain\u2019s illicit narcotics scene, regardless of whether they\u2019re class A, B or Z. To get ahead of the game, safe supply is the only logical solution.\n Niko Vorobyov is a Russian-British freelance journalist, convicted drug peddler and author of Dopeworld"},

It is out of date and wrong", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "teaser": "I feel strongly that any association of citizens in a free society should be allowed to make its own rules. But this ban is absurd", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 13.09 CET", "content": "Do clubs matter? Yes, to their members, and clearly to those they exclude. When Alexis de Tocqueville compared American democracy with British, he said America\u2019s roots were in the mob and Britain\u2019s in the club. Americans vote for a president who doesn\u2019t sit in Congress. Britons vote for a member of parliament, a tight-knit Westminster club.\nThe revived argument over London\u2019s Garrick Club would have been music to De Tocqueville\u2019s ears. Here we go again, a gang of London elitists ruling the land from a Covent Garden palace untainted by plebs or women. And this in the 21st century. Give us a break.\nPlaces where those of like mind can meet and enjoy each other\u2019s company are valuable. They enrich leisure and guard against loneliness. As guilds, lodges and associations, they exist in every community \u2013 including some for men and women separately. London\u2019s clubs are a case in point. The Garrick, where I am a member, is not some fiendish hotbed of influence. Its average age is about 70 and those who frequent it are overwhelmingly retired. In my view, it cannot be regarded as a significant centre of power, but rather a good place to eat and entertain. It is popular and certainly livelier than traditional clubland haunts.\nThe Garrick was named after the actor David Garrick, as the club for London\u2019s theatrical and arts community. Its \u201caffinity\u201d was no different from the military clubs\u2019 exclusion of certain classes of soldier or the university clubs\u2019 restriction to Oxbridge. All originally excluded women. Many clubs such as Brooks\u2019s, Boodle\u2019s, the Travellers and the Savile continue this exclusion of women, or exclusion of men in the case of the University Women\u2019s. The Savile kept its cool in 2017 when it allowed a member to stay after they transitioned to become a woman. Margaret Thatcher was made a member of the men-only Carlton Club in 1975, largely because no one dared exclude her.\nWhat makes the Garrick different \u2013 and has attracted media attention \u2013 is that some of its members are prominent in public affairs, including, apparently, the king. He is not known to have used the club. Membership seems to confer networking power beyond its walls. In particular, the Garrick has long been favoured by senior lawyers, with a profusion of senior judges. The judiciary is a largely self-governing profession and many lawyers \u2013 not only women \u2013 have come to regard membership as divisive and potentially a kind of freemasonry. Earlier this week a number of judges were pressed into resigning. It is within the legal world these concerns are concentrated. I really do not think such a charge could be directed at other professions at the club. It is merely absurd, not career-damaging, that Stephen Fry can belong to the Garrick, but not Judi Dench.\nIn truth, the Garrick\u2019s problem over women attracts publicity because, unlike the other all-male clubs, it contains a large number of progressive members who want women in and who have been fighting for it for years. In the last two votes on women, in 2015 and last autumn, a clear majority was in favour, but the rules stated that two-thirds was required to carry. Legal opinion has since been sought, and it is plain that there is no actual rule opposing female members. There is therefore no rule that has to be changed. The membership committee can simply allow women to join.\nI feel strongly that any association of citizens in a free society should be allowed to hold its own opinions and make its own rules, from political parties to London clubs. But for me, the exclusion of women from havens of civilised conversation and debate is the opposite of liberal. It is out of date and wrong.\nIn the case of the Garrick, this is not a purely private matter. The club has become a symbolic institution on London\u2019s cultural scene, its exclusivity a practice that should long ago have ended. The majority of its members clearly want that discrimination to end. I sense it is about to happen. I look forward to celebrating it.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},
{"headline": "It\u2019s not unpatriotic to tell the whole truth about Britain and the end of slavery", "author": "Ella Sinclair", "teaser": "The mooted memorial to the navy\u2019s West Africa Squadron seems to be an attempt to rewrite history in a more favourable light", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 15.25 CET", "content": "Until very recently, most people in Britain would have said that this country\u2019s most significant involvement in the transatlantic slave trade was our heroic decision to abolish it. In the past few years, this culturally ingrained consensus has been challenged by a renewed attention to Britain\u2019s long-lasting legacy of slavery \u2013 and to the many families and institutions that profited from the enslavement of Africans. In the ongoing struggle to determine the meaning of this history, individuals and institutions across Britain\u2019s political spectrum are grappling with the same pivotal question: how do we remember our past?\nFor the campaigners seeking to build a new monument in Portsmouth commemorating Britain\u2019s West Africa Squadron \u2013 the Royal Navy unit tasked with intercepting slave ships after Britain outlawed the trade in 1807 \u2013 the answer is simple.\nColin Kemp, the retired businessman who is raising \u00a370,000 to put up a statue of a naval officer freeing an enslaved African, launched his campaign in the Daily Mail with the frank declaration: \u201cI think we have got very little to apologise for.\u201d\nPenny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, is among the many Tory peers and MPs loudly backing the memorial, which has also received a \u00a325,000 donation from the party\u2019s former deputy chair Michael Ashcroft. \u201cYes, Britain had a role in the slave trade,\u201d Mordaunt wrote in the Daily Mail. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear about something else too. We ended it. Our biggest contribution to the evil trade was to end it.\u201d\nThe statue\u2019s backers see their campaign as a correction to what Mordaunt calls \u201canti-British, grievance-based\u201d attempts to \u201crewrite our history in the bleakest way\u201d. But their own account of the squadron\u2019s history is a rose-tinted one, which neglects historical facts and erases space for a more nuanced memory of Britain\u2019s past.\nThe campaign\u2019s fundraising website claims, incorrectly, that \u201cBritain was the first country to ban slavery, we used our own ships, men and money to enforce this ban\u201d. (Denmark was the first European country to ban the slave trade, in 1803, and Haiti was established as the world\u2019s first free Black republic in 1804.) Echoing the campaigners, Mordaunt claims that the West Africa Squadron, which was active until the 1860s, was \u201cthe main actor in physically destroying the slave trade\u201d, but this is a dramatic overstatement: though the squadron is credited with capturing 1,600 ships and freeing 150,000 enslaved Africans, more than 3 million people were trafficked across the Atlantic while it was active.\nAccording to the campaign, the statue will depict three key parts of the story of the West Africa Squadron: \u201cthe evil of slavery, the bravery of the sailors and the new life for the freed Africans\u201d.\nBritain banned the slave trade in 1807, after almost 20 years of parliamentary debate on the matter. It took another quarter-century for Britain to abolish slavery across the empire, and another five years after that for the full emancipation of the enslaved.\nThe West Africa Squadron was deployed from 1808 with the task of stopping British slave-trading ships, but this initial enforcement took on a more humanitarian bent as the squadron began to target the ships of other countries as well. The campaign for a monument is correct that significant resources were committed to this mission: over a period of 60 years, the Royal Navy spent millions of pounds on the squadron, and 1,600 sailors lost their lives. But even this was hugely insufficient: the ships were old, slow and too few in number, and the unit is estimated to have intercepted fewer than 10% of the ships involved in the slave trade.\nMore significantly, \u201cthe new life for the freed Africans\u201d rescued by the squadron was hardly free. The estimated 150,000 men, women and children whose ships were captured suffered continued exploitation and degradation at the hands of the British.\nAfter intercepting slave ships bound for the Americas, the West Africa Squadron sailed the formerly enslaved human cargo to British colonies; namely, Sierra Leone and Saint Helena. Once docked, captured Africans were made to remain onboard ships for long periods (sometimes months) in squalid conditions while lengthy British bureaucracy ensued: this led to high rates of unnecessary deaths and disease.\nOnce allowed off the ships, the \u201cliberated Africans\u201d \u2013 as they were known at the time \u2013 were not repatriated to their home countries; they were instead subject to forced hard labour under poor conditions, reminiscent of the slavery they narrowly escaped. Military conscription was the fate of \u201cliberated\u201d men; \u201cliberated\u201d children were subject to apprenticeship, where they worked for a master with no wage for a number of years. In Sierra Leone, there are reports of unmarried \u201cliberated\u201d women being forced into marriage.\nThe legitimate effort to remember the history of the West Africa Squadron should not require the repetition of falsehoods, like the myth of the \u201cliberated Africans\u201d or the misconception that the Royal Navy \u201cended slavery\u201d.\nEmancipation was not simply given to the enslaved by benevolent sailors. It was fought for. This history deserves commemoration just as much as the advocacy of William Wilberforce and the work of the squadron. Britain\u2019s decision to finally abolish slavery in 1833 was itself influenced by the 1831-32 slave revolt in Jamaica, also known as the Christmas rebellion, which helped shock parliament into acting.\nOne year ago, in a powerful essay for the Guardian\u2019s Cotton Capital project, Gary Younge addressed our nation\u2019s ability to \u201cforget\u201d the gritty realities of our slaving past. Far from an innocent moment of amnesia, this \u201cforgetting\u201d is a destructive task, and a \u201cprivilege of the powerful\u201d.\nWhat we choose to remember of Britain\u2019s legacy of slavery does not seem to require adherence to historical fact, but refers instead to some axiomatic, felt understanding about who we are as a nation. And so the pursuit of historical truth becomes an \u201canti-British\u201d blasphemy, seen as an attempt to vandalise the myth that Britain\u2019s only relationship to slavery was to abolish it.\nAcknowledging the complicated history of the West Africa Squadron is not an unpatriotic lament; it is part of establishing a healthier relationship with the complexities of our past, based on a sturdier and more honest foundation. Britain\u2019s history of abolition can still be a proud one \u2013 as long as it is not built on mistruths.\nElla Sinclair is a freelance writer who covers race, history, politics and social justice\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Sam Bankman-Fried will grow old in jail. But don\u2019t forget those who basked in his orbit", "author": "Aditya Chakrabortty", "teaser": "If the high-rollers surrounding the disgraced FTX founder had any qualms about taking his money, they didn\u2019t show it", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 07.00 CET", "content": "Later today, a man who has recently turned 32 will be hauled in front of a Manhattan judge. Already convicted of huge fraud, he knows he\u2019s going to prison. The only question is for how long. If the US government gets its way, he will not emerge before his 80th birthday.\nThis is the final disgrace of Sam Bankman-Fried. The judge, politicians and the world\u2019s press will declare him one of the biggest swindlers in American history. They will note how within three years he built a marketplace for digital currencies, or crypto, that was worth around $32bn \u2013 and made himself the world\u2019s richest person under 30. Still it wasn\u2019t enough. He spent perhaps $8bn of his customers\u2019 savings on luxury homes, risky investments and whatever else took his fancy.\nBut remember this. Those same groups who today come to bury the boy billionaire yesterday praised him without qualification \u2013 and took as much of his cash as they could. While battling Donald Trump in 2020, Joe Biden received about $5m from Bankman-Fried. He wasn\u2019t alone. Mitt Romney, Cory Booker, Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi: they and so many other Democrats and Republicans accepted collectively tens of millions.\nAlso on the payroll to endorse Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading exchange, FTX, were celebrities and sports stars, from Larry David (who got a reported $10m to make one ad) to Gisele B\u00fcndchen and her then partner, the quarterback Tom Brady, the tennis player Naomi Osaka and the basketball legend Shaquille O\u2019Neal. If these high-rollers had the faintest qualm about taking huge sums from a young man who had dropped out of nowhere to head a business based in a tax haven, they didn\u2019t let it stop them taking his dollars.Less than a minute on Google will show you photos of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton at a conference organised by Bankman-Fried. At his invitation, the two statesmen had flown to the financiers\u2019 paradise of the Bahamas; there they sit, stiffly onstage in dark suits while the prodigy slouches in a grubby T-shirt and shorts. He may be less than half their age, but there is no doubt who\u2019s in charge, or who\u2019s picking up the tab. It was spring 2022, only months before Bankman-Fried was arrested and extradited back to the US.\nUp until then, the billionaire dined with Jeff Bezos and Leonardo DiCaprio. He hobnobbed with pop stars. Upon meeting, Katy Perry posted on Instagram: \u201cim quitting music and becoming an intern for @ftx_official ok.\u201d He was hosannaed on the covers of business magazines and a regular on American TV. The profiles depicted him as an idiot savant who slept next to his desk on a beanbag and worked amid day-old containers of chickpea korma.\nLess space was devoted to the $40m penthouse in which he actually lived, looking out on to a yacht-filled marina, or to his upbringing as the son of two Stanford Law professors, who\u2019d sent him to private school before the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Who wanted dreary old facts when you could have the American dream?\nAfter he was arrested and his bail was set at an almost-impossible $250m, they managed to raise the funds. Far too much was made of how he was amassing this fortune only to give it away, following a philosophy dubbed effective altruism. One journalist was savvy enough to do the maths and point out: \u201cSo far he\u2019s donated less to charity than he\u2019s spent on naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s arena.\u201d\nMore than hypocrisy by people who just wanted their next pay cheque, it helped to create his fortune. Among those who plunged millions into FTX were some of the biggest names in finance. One, a Silicon Valley firm called Sequoia Capital, not only gave its money: it ran a near-14,000 word hagiography of Bankman-Fried on its website. When things went south a few weeks later, the piece was taken down. But with typical generosity, the web has archived it. Among the highlights is how Sequoia\u2019s partners met Bankman-Fried over Zoom. They asked how he saw the future of FTX.\nRather than focus on the interview, Bankman-Fried is playing a video game, notes the piece. He says laconically: \u201cI want FTX to be a place where you can do anything you want with your next dollar. You can buy bitcoin. You can send money in whatever currency to any friend anywhere in the world. You can buy a banana.\u201d\nThen, the piece records: \u201cSuddenly, the chat window on Sequoia\u2019s side of the Zoom lights up with partners freaking out.\u201d\n\u201cI LOVE THIS FOUNDER,\u201d typed one partner \u2026 \u201cYES!!!\u201d exclaimed a second.\nAnother responded excitedly: \u201cI am a 10 out of 10.\u201d\nA pudding-faced boy in baggy shorts says he wants to buy a banana with internet money and some of the greatest minds in finance go wild. Just remember: it is this same class of geniuses in bodywarmers who Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves believe will finance our new green industries.\nIf in these stories you can hear echoes of Jay Gatsby, that is no accident. The Great Gatsby was published in 1925, amid one of the great financial bubbles in world history. Wall Street went bust in 1929, and when the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote his masterful history The Great Crash, 1929, he diagnosed how economically exuberant societies indulged the same financial crimes they would later drag into court. He called this \u201cthe bezzle\u201d.\n\u201cIn good times people are relaxed, trusting, and money is plentiful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut even though money is plentiful, there are always many people who need more. Under these circumstances the rate of embezzlement grows, the rate of discovery falls off, and the bezzle increases rapidly.\u201dWhen the crash comes, everything changes. \u201cMoney is watched with a narrow, suspicious eye. The man who handles it is assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise \u2026 The bezzle shrinks.\u201dAs Galbraith makes clear, financial crimes aren\u2019t purveyed only by evil masterminds. They are licensed by entire societies who believe in them \u2013 until they don\u2019t. Bankman-Fried\u2019s great fall from grace began shortly after US interest rates began marching upwards, in the summer of 2022.\nIn many ways, his story is of how an entire decade of cheap money and high hopes for a new economic paradigm was squandered. His crimes are his own to atone for. But his disgrace is the disgrace of a much larger financial and political establishment. The old guard spent years waiting for a new saviour to come along and rescue them from the doldrums of the banking crash. When a boy pulled up in a battered Corolla, they got in without asking too many questions.\nAditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

{"headline": "Britain seems stuck in a doom loop of poverty. I have a plan to raise billions to address that ", "author": "Gordon Brown", "teaser": "With will and ingenuity, communities, charities, companies and government could work together to rescue millions of people", "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.46 CET", "content": "An election year is the time to confront the paralysing gloom and declinist thinking besetting our country and, by rediscovering our moral compass, inaugurate a new age of hope.\nThe British people long to feel part of a shared national endeavour. But instead, near-zero growth is giving birth to a zero-sum mentality, a belief that you can only do better if at someone else\u2019s expense. Young people \u2013 historically the most optimistic about the future \u2013 yearn to believe in something bigger than themselves, yet this generation is fast losing faith in the very idea of progress. But the most devastating twist in this doom loop is the one created by rising poverty, the despair and divisions it causes, and the mounting public concern about its impact on our social cohesion. To break out of this downward spiral, Britain needs a reason for optimism \u2013 and a good starting point is a new partnership to end destitution and poverty that, by bringing charities, companies, communities and government together in a common national project, shows the United Kingdom can be united in more than just name.\nFor these are desperate times for today\u2019s poor children. That 4.3 million children \u2013 a number equivalent to four cities the size of Birmingham \u2013 were last week declared to be below the official poverty line is shameful enough, but on the ground we are now witnessing types of penury we once imagined we had consigned to history. Children now form 1.5 million of the 6 million people enduring \u2018very deep\u2019 poverty, living not only below the standard breadline, drawn at 60% of the typical income, but below 40%. One million children are thought to have had a recent brush with \u2018destitution\u2019, defined as being without the absolute basics: keeping warm, dry, clean, housed and fed.\nLast night, 140,000 children were homeless, and 1.1 million youngsters tried to go to sleep without a bed of their own; it is estimated that 2.6 million children are missing out on meals. No society can or should be at ease when children are being brought up in houses without heating, kitchens without cookers, bedrooms without beds, floors without floor covering, or toilets without toilet roll or soap. And all the evidence is that, unless we act, things will get even worse.\nBut how to fix it? Three seismic shifts have unfolded over the last decade. First, the welfare safety net has been systematically shredded, with the government abandoning responsibilities taken for granted since 1945. Second, charities and food banks, which have taken over from universal credit as the last line of defence, are exhausted and justifiably angry about having to pick up the pieces with insufficient resources. They even fear their desperate relief efforts could provide cover for the government walking further away. Third, unsure how they fit into a poverty-free, pollution-free future, the corporate sector has in the last decade donated less, not more. Yet the many business leaders who are now championing a greater sense of environmental and social responsibility know they can, and should, play a bigger role.\nWith Jeremy Hunt now hinting at an autumn mini-budget, this government has a last chance to break with the past decade and offer hope to millions by setting out a firm timetable for abolishing destitution and ending extreme poverty.\nThere can be no ducking the changing nature of the poverty we are addressing. A generation ago, worklessness was the overwhelming cause. Today, nearly three poor children in four live in a working household and no government can perpetuate the myth any more that the majority of our poor people are workshy or part of a dependency culture. Alongside a root-and-branch review of universal credit to reflect this, we should be raising the pay floor, creating new opportunities to climb the career ladder including through better skills (today only one in six on low pay ever escape low pay), and rewiring the various markets \u2013 for utilities, travel, rented housing and childcare \u2013 that are currently skewed against poorer families. We should offer NHS help to those who are sick and economically inactive to restore their fitness before delivering any lectures on laziness.\nBut action cannot await reviews and phased reforms, however necessary. Were the government to declare the end of poverty to be a national goal and set clear deadlines, there would be a way out of the current emergency. Then it could credibly invite charities, corporations and community and civil society groups to join a time-limited partnership to alleviate poverty now. Only then will it be understood that the shared goal is not to for ever fall back on food banks in place of the necessary long-term solutions, but to create immediate breathing space as government transitions us away from mass poverty.\nWithin the bounds of the fiscal envelope, government can build on the \u00a31bn a year that has until now been allocated to the household support fund. A start could be made with between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a33.3bn found by imposing a similar reserve requirement on banks that the European Central Bank, the Swiss and others currently do (and we once did), thus hypothecating for poverty eradication a small fraction of what banks currently receive in interest payments on their balances at the Bank of England.\nBy simplifying the Gift Aid system, \u00a3700m of ancillary relief, which currently can end up being back with higher-earning donors, can go straight to good causes. And the Chancellor\u2019s autumn statement could also offer additional time-limited tax incentives to encourage more giving. The top 1% donate overall just 0.2% of their income \u2013 that\u2019s just \u00a3538 a year from average incomes of \u00a3271,000. But if that top 1% were incentivised to donate just 1%, \u00a31.4 billion a year could be raised for good causes.\nSome companies take corporate philanthropy seriously, but overall their donations represent just 0.8% of the pretax profits of FTSE 100 companies. But even if the real value of their donations had remained at its level of ten years ago, good causes would now be at least \u00a35bn better off.\nFor the period of this current emergency, companies should consider donating more of their surplus products \u2013 and so reduce pollution as well as poverty. But if they cannot give free of charge, they should offer to sell to charities essential goods \u2013 toothpaste, nappies, toilet rolls, soap and shampoo, as well as food \u2013 at production cost or less.\nIf we share the discounted cost, and if families are referred through social workers, teachers, health visitors and GPs as well as food banks, we would be getting vital goods to those too impoverished to buy, and doing so in the most cost-effective way. Indeed, in the pilot phase of the new Multibanks \u2013 which sit alongside food banks and are food, clothes, bedding, toiletries, furnishings, and baby banks rolled into one \u2013 every \u00a31 donated has procured supplies worth \u00a35 in value.\nThis partnership is not a permanent or comprehensive solution. It would be a one- or two-year transitional arrangement, which would only succeed if the government offers benefit improvements that exceed the value of what others provide in kind. It would not be the end of poverty, but it is the signal the whole country needs: the beginning of the end. It would address the costs crippling families now, and create the headroom in which to fix our welfare safety net. With communities, charities, companies and government working together to deliver a shared national goal, we can rapidly banish destitution, and support the 2,600 food banks in their ambition to make themselves redundant \u2013 and a divided country can find unity, and hope, again.\nGordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"},
{"headline": "\u2018Neighbourhood restaurants\u2019 \u2013 really? These Instagrammable impostors are nothing of the sort", "author": "Lauren O'Neill", "teaser": "The term evokes cosiness, affordability and community. But it\u2019s being used as a cynical marketing ploy", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 10.00 CET", "content": "What makes a neighbourhood restaurant? The phrase itself is evocative, bringing to mind the types of local trattorias or ocakba\u015flar\u0131 or tavernas that punters return to regularly. The definition might vary from person to person, but surely a neighbourhood restaurant is defined by some combination of its longevity in the community, an accessible feel and affordable prices.\nOver the past six months, though, I have seen the \u201cneighbourhood restaurant\u201d label deployed constantly in PR emails previewing a very different sort of establishment. The aim, I imagine, is to evoke a sense of cosiness and community \u2013 but there\u2019s something off about it.\nThese self-proclaimed neighbourhood restaurants usually feel something like this: the walls are white, wines are \u201clow-intervention\u201d (meaning natural), and the branding is jaunty and Instagram-scroll friendly. \u201cSeasonal ingredients\u201d and \u201cmodern European\u201d dishes abound. You might expect a neighbourhood restaurant by definition to respond to the specific needs of its neighbourhood, but a lot of these places actually tend to be pretty identikit, informed above all else by a more ambient, social media-aware aesthetic.\nThese clean, neat spaces recall the journalist Kyle Chayka\u2019s concept of AirSpace, or, as he puts it, \u201cthe strangely frictionless geography created by digital platforms, in which you could move between places without \u2026 leaving the bubble of the generic aesthetic\u201d.\nIn London, these so-called neighbourhood spots spring up in areas like Islington or Hackney, or any other place with a high concentration of upwardly mobile digital natives. These are consumers who snap photos of expensive pastries and hunt down dishes hyped up online, for whom food is yet another aspect of a curated, postable lifestyle.\nAs someone who has, in her time, queued 45 minutes for a falafel sandwich seen online, I am admittedly part of the crowd whose tastes these places are designed to appeal to. I don\u2019t mind saying that some of what I enjoy is governed by what I see on my phone: I like pretty plates of crudo and thick slices of terrine that look lovely in a photo. Nor do I begrudge a savvy restaurant using the world\u2019s biggest marketing platforms to its advantage (unless the food is rubbish). At the same time, neighbourhood restaurant rankles as a marketing term because it feels like it is often used by the kind of restaurants that often don\u2019t have an awful lot to do with their local communities.\nThere is a likely reason behind the recent use of the term. Within food media there is a growing, but long overdue, appreciation of the food of migrant and working-class communities, hitherto overlooked by some in the mainstream. As a result of this emphasis on diversity, readers and diners have a sharper understanding of the roles restaurants play in their communities.\nAs far as I can see, then, \u201cneighbourhood restaurant\u201d can be deployed pretty cynically, to detract from the accusations of gentrification that are now frequently \u2013 and usually correctly \u2013 levelled at flashy new restaurant openings in areas where wealth disparities are high, and longstanding local communities continue to be priced out. But you can\u2019t simply declare yourself a neighbourhood restaurant in a press release or social media bio and make it so. It is surely a status that is earned.\nActual neighbourhood restaurants \u2013 examples quickly plucked from my own recent dining experiences include east London\u2019s brilliant Al Kahf, the jovial Bar D4100 in Nunhead, south-east London, or Kababish in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley \u2013 rarely claim to be as such. They just are, because they\u2019re placed to appeal to a wide range of punters and to serve them with a mix of affordability, local knowledge, quality and a welcoming atmosphere.\nLots of these restaurants integrate seamlessly because they\u2019ve been started by local people \u2013 for instance, Dinner for One Hundred, the family business behind Bar D4100, started life in the founders\u2019 mum\u2019s garden during lockdown \u2013 or because they\u2019ve made an effort to be a genuine part of the community, like east London\u2019s Dusty Knuckle bakeries, whose youth programmes give jobs to young people in those areas looking for a new start.\nA high-profile example of the way in which some \u201cneighbourhood restaurants\u201d are said to fall short of this standard is Straker\u2019s, the chef Thomas Straker\u2019s eponymous restaurant, which opened on Notting Hill\u2019s Golborne Road in 2022. The restaurant is described on its own website as \u201cserving a neighbourhood vibe\u201d (a main will set you back about \u00a330); but in July 2023, when Straker posted a photo of the restaurant\u2019s on-shift kitchen staff, they were all white and male. Considering the venue in west London is on a street known for its Portuguese and Moroccan immigrant communities, the image was called out as tone-deaf. Critics asked why there had not been more of an effort to compile a staff team that was representative of the area.\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard, Straker said that while his business \u201ccan always be better\u201d, he found some social media users\u2019 insinuation that he and his chefs all looked the same \u201cincredibly offensive to the point where \u2026 actually they should apologise\u201d. In the same interview, the restaurateur said he had changed his hiring practices since the photo was taken.\nStraker\u2019s isn\u2019t the only restaurant accused of just plonking itself down without considering the context. The growing practice is a symptom of our increasingly siloed cities, as gentrification rages on, and community spaces continue to close due to a lack of funding. There are, then, some labels that require responsibility: if you want the kudos of calling yourself a neighbourhood restaurant, the least you can do is actually act like one.\nLauren O\u2019Neill is a culture writer"},

Come to Poland: see how they can be pushed back ", "author": "Anne McElvoy", "teaser": "Donald Tusk is working hard and fast on a great transformation, but travel the country and it\u2019s clear what a difficult task that is", "published": "Thu 28 Mar 2024 08.00 CET", "content": "My formative journalistic years were spent reporting on the final freeze of the cold war \u2013 days of hard times and soft currencies. When I return to those countries now, I test myself on how well I guessed what would follow in the three decades since. On Poland in particular, I would have been hard pressed to predict the giddy zigzag of power still featuring a generation who marched to topple communism, but whose protagonists feud bitterly about how to govern the country in the 21st century.\nWe talk a lot about places that have recently bought a one-way ticket towards authoritarian politics \u2013 Russia and Turkey for the full-fat versions, and Hungary\u2019s democratic backsliding and stifling of independent institutions.\nI had pondered about what happens when a country that embraced populist nationalism does a 180-degree turn and seeks to restore legal and democratic norms at top speed. What happens to laws passed under the previous masters of the house: the courts, state media, and business and other institutions stuffed by supporters of one side?\nPoland, in the wake of an election last year that ended eight years of rule by the rightwing Law and Justice party in favour of a coalition headed by Donald Tusk\u2019s Civil Platform, is in the eye of all these legal, ethical and practical storms. A documentary for BBC Radio 4 gave me the chance to chart this volte-face as the Tusk government takes an \u201ciron broom\u201d to sweep away a legacy of ultra-conservative rule.\nBut there\u2019s also the story that is more nuanced and paradoxical here: the new government won an election, and forged an alliance in power that represents a lot of the country \u2013 but by no means all of it. As it sweeps away obstacles to its will, it will need to restore pluralism to avoid repeating aspects of the absolutism it replaces.\nFor a government led by Tusk, a bullish pro-European veteran of centrist politics who is not of the charm school persuasion (Brexiters were on the receiving end of his mordant style when he wished the Johnsonian variety a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d), and with little common ground yet visible, that might well be the difference between a durable return to the centre of politics and yet another hairpin change of direction.\nBut as my producer and I travelled from the buzzy streets of Warsaw, via the Law and Justice stronghold of Wadowice \u2013 where a lady coming out of the basilica responded tartly to the question about Tusk\u2019s government by saying it was \u201ctime he came back to God\u201d \u2013 to Krak\u00f3w, to speak to one woman caught up in the implementation of draconian abortion laws, it felt like veering giddily from one world to another. People claimed that they understood the destiny of their country while turning a deaf ear to others\u2019 views.\nIt is not hard for western European liberals to identify with a figure like the deputy justice minister, Dariusz Mazur, who describes himself as \u201cvery tired\u201d after years of tussle over control of courts, regulators and legal certification bodies. For him, it\u2019s about cleaning out a judicial system stacked by Law and Justice \u2013 while avoiding the obvious pitfall of this government being seen as replacing one lot of favourites with another.\nThere\u2019s also a fraught dealing here with the idea of Europe. The Tusk government is EU friendly: he is a veteran of Brussels and adept at working it to appeal to Poland\u2019s desire to be taken more seriously. A return to the European \u201cfamily\u201d and access to EU-derived funds was part of the appeal. The \u201ciron broom\u201d, however, might have met a hard stop as the European Central Bank raises objections to the Tusk government\u2019s threat of a tribunal aimed to oust Poland\u2019s central bank boss, on the grounds that it infringes the bank\u2019s independence.\nThese attempts to eradicate eight years of a rightward \u201cstate capture\u201d, with personal cronyism as well as ideology, guarantee a lengthy period of institutional muddle \u2013 it\u2019s not even clear whether the president, Andrzej Duda (loyal to the old team), will allow the prime minister to swap out ambassadors he wants recalled.\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nTusk has been (by his uncompromising standards) conciliatory in insisting that this is a recalibration \u201cnot a retaliation\u201d, though it\u2019s hard to see that landing well with a large chunk of voters whose rightwing party won the largest share of the vote at the election. And the new government is held together by a coalition that itself contains many shades of opinion, infuriating the many young activists and voters who helped drive change by turning out en masse to oust Law and Justice \u2013 and now hanker for faster results on abortion and other social reforms.\nEconomically, a thriving Poland defies my expectations as the country I remember from the doldrums of the late 1980s, when a stint in the Dickensian conditions of Warsaw\u2019s Rosa Luxemburg lightbulb factory would have been enough to put anyone off thinking that communism was an illuminating idea.\nNow, it\u2019s approached the EU average on household wealth, ahead of Spain and nudging Ireland, and the main cities feel like cosmopolitan havens, with a new sprinkling of Ukrainians who have fled west to start new lives \u2013 my friend\u2019s dog-clipper is from Kharkiv, my manicurist fled from Odesa.\nThe new Poland still bears the echoes of grim events. But it might well turn out to be a test case for other states or movements in Europe and beyond that one day want to turn back from the \u201cultra\u201d model. The moral of this story is that it\u2019s necessary \u2013 but not easy.\nAnne McElvoy is executive editor of Politico.

But the Financial Times has recently revealed just how drastically the scales have tipped: about 40% of 18- to 34-year-olds now live with their parents, making it the most common domestic arrangement for this age group. Previously, it was living as a couple with children.\nIt\u2019s not just an epidemic of Young, Dumb and Living Off Mum \u2013 I\u2019ve moved back home twice since graduating in 2018, and I know plenty of young well-to-do professionals who have felt obliged to do the same, or not moved out at all. There are also plenty of people who are unable to live in their family home due to distance and perhaps wish they could.\nAnd even though it\u2019s framed in terms of the housing crisis, so long as you\u2019re not trapped in an abusive household, being able to live at home is an immense privilege \u2013 it helps you to save and means you have more money for recreation. But beyond the column inches on the state of the housing market, there is also the question of what this situation means for the state of family relationships, and if it damages them or is a welcome reprieve from \u201cempty nest syndrome\u201d.\nParents are typically happy to alleviate their children\u2019s housing costs if it will help them to set up their future, particularly in an economic climate so different from the time when they themselves were finding homes and building families. And sometimes parents are all the better for keeping their children home. Of course there will be tensions and frustrations, as there are whenever adults spend extended periods of time together, but with the loneliness and emotional distress of empty nest syndrome often cited as a cause of marital breakdown, there is some light to be found in staying at home longer.\nAlso, if your parents are single or widowed, like my mother, it can introduce the possibility of maintaining an adult relationship in the home that they have been missing. Certainly, while I have radical views on the housing market and resent that I\u2019m forced to live at home due to the cost of everything, it has brought my mother and I closer in a way that may not have been possible if I had been living away from home for an unbroken period during the past six years.\nPeople often speak of a sadness they experience watching their parents age, but there is something to be said about being able to adjust to it by witnessing it more gradually, rather than being taken aback by their advancing age at each periodic visit.\nBut the feasibility of staying home often relies on how well you\u2019re able to get along with your parents (and other adult siblings) and whether or not you\u2019ll rub each other up the wrong way. For some young adults \u2013 particularly those who have spent three or more years living independently at university \u2013 it can feel like a regression into childhood dynamics \u2013 nagging about dishes, the blue or pink paint of your childhood bedroom, having to confirm what time you\u2019ll be home and feeling guilty if your parents have waited up for you after a night partying.\nThen there are the privacy issues. Everyone has heard an icky horror story of a parent coming into their child\u2019s bedroom and discovering lingerie or a sex toy. And if your parents aren\u2019t as liberal as Regina George\u2019s in Mean Girls, you might end up either forking out a fortune on hotels just to be able to have sex with a partner who also lives at home, or restricting liaisons to when your parents are away.\nOne flip side to remaining with your parents is the rush to partner-up and move in together so you can split bills while recovering some privacy, or finding yourself more attracted to a person you would typically overlook purely because they can accommodate you. The romantic consequences of which are picking a partner for the wrong reasons and splitting up quickly, or the relationship being undone by the early pressure of cohabitation, ultimately leading you back to your blue-walled bedroom again.\nRegardless of the financial and emotional benefits, or the drawbacks, of living at home, that this has become the default arrangement for young people is troubling and consequential. Last year I was dismayed to read about two adult children being removed from their family\u2019s social housing after their mother died suddenly from an aneurysm. Particularly if you only live with one parent, it can only take one incident for your security blanket to be snatched away \u2013 so you end up hyperconscious of the health of your parent.\nIt might be nice to spend more time with your parents as they age, and to have more cash for a holiday or nice things, but some unintended positive side-effects do not detract from the simple fact that cheaper secure housing remains a core demand for young people.\nJason Okundaye is a London-based writer and author of Revolutionary Acts: Black Gay Men in Britain"}
