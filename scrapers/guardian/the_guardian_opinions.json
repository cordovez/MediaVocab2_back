        "content": "Not since Trotsky vanished from the Soviet politburo portrait has photo-editing caused such a storm. What dark secrets lie behind the daughter’s misaligned sweater, the blurred skirt and the twisted zip? What dynastic horror is being concealed by the Princess of Wales’s missing wedding ring? What are we not being told?\nQuestions over the princess’s abdominal operation follow hard on the heels of those over the king’s cancer. Both suggest something has been seriously wrong with the health of senior members of the royal family, something that they want to keep private. It has not worked. That subtlest of art forms, publicity manipulation, has gone awry. The palace must be asking, where is some nonsense from Prince Harry when we most need it?\nThe picture of the Princess of Wales and her children published over the weekend could hardly have been more charming and reassuring. After weeks of seclusion, she appeared smiling, hale and hearty. Good for her. If something went a bit fuzzy with the picture of her hand, so what? Her face is what matters. We can surely congratulate her on apparently being well, and turn the page.\nExcept that has not happened. The reality is that since the early years of Queen Elizabeth, the British royal family has validated itself through the medium of publicity. It did not follow most of Europe’s “cycling monarchies” into modesty and privacy. It did not treat its anachronistic status as purely ceremonial. The Queen presented her monarchy in full historic majesty, represented by an extended family of uncles, aunts and cousins with an estate of palaces, titles and functions, all involving serious money.\nThere was only one form of legitimacy in this approach: that it was popular. British royalty relied on its celebrity, promoted worldwide. Broadly speaking, it worked. The Queen, King Charles and Prince William have been ideally cast. If others didn’t follow the script – Princesses Margaret and Diana and Prince Harry – they were almost perfect foils. But to the end of time, the institution of monarchy will depend on popular support. That is why its handling of the media is crucial. Press officers are its brigade of guards.\nThe iron law of celebrity states that there can be no such thing as privacy. There may be sympathy. There may be understanding. But there is no secrecy. The column inches and websites, once brought to life, are aching to be filled. They ache even more today, galvanised by an undisciplined and unregulated digital media, free to pour its poison into a world where lies are cash. The social media treatment of the health of the Princess of Wales has been disgusting. That such material should be unpoliced and legal is a scandal.\nThe moral of the editing of the royal picture is simple. Tell all. The princess has now admitted she edited the photograph but not, at this stage, why or what she edited out. At this stage, privacy does not work. It breeds rumour, gossip and fabrication. When fake news and fake pictures are rampant, secrecy is the enemy of truth. Just say what the matter is. It is more likely to generate respect.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "MPs, understand this: protests are inevitable when you fail to represent the people",
        "author": "Andy Beckett",
        "teaser": "Politics is not just an activity conducted in Westminster corridors, with the voters locked out – as marches over the climate crisis and Gaza show",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 14.01 CET",
        "content": "Where should politics happen? For most MPs, accustomed to the Palace of Westminster’s inward-looking spaces and rituals, the answer is obvious. In parliament and its associated offices, corridors, committee rooms, bars and tea rooms; in Downing Street and its surrounding maze of ministries; and in the parts of the media that mould political opinion.\nThis country is supposed to be a representative democracy. Except for very occasional referendums, periodic elections, voxpops and opinion polls, or perhaps the odd exchange with their MP, voters are not meant to be directly involved. A sign of a healthy political system, we are often told, is one where most people get on with their lives and leave politics to the professionals.\nBut Britain doesn’t feel like that kind of place now. Political professionals – whether MPs, ministers or party functionaries – are regarded by many voters with contempt: as incompetent, corrupt, uninspiring, or a combination of all three. Meanwhile the public spaces of Westminster and the centres of other cities are busier with protests than they have been for years. Gaza, the climate crisis, cuts to public services, the crisis in farming and other huge and urgent causes compete for attention, week after week. On many weekends, last Saturday being the latest example, much of central London in particular has changed from a place dominated by consumerism, tourism and statues of dead politicians to a place of banners, placards, chants, speeches, blocked roads and activists climbing lamp-posts, with coloured smoke gushing from protesters’ flares and police helicopters endlessly throbbing overhead.\nFor some politicians, many but not all of them Conservative, this is almost a vision of hell. The language they use to criticise the pro-Palestinian and climate protesters in particular is strikingly strong, describing them as extremists, thugs, hate marchers, a mob – despite the protests’ overwhelmingly peaceful nature. Even slightly less intolerant members of the government have had enough. The Gaza demonstrators “have made a point and … made it very, very loudly,” said the home secretary, James Cleverly, last month. “I’m not sure that these marches every couple of weeks add value to the argument.”\nSome of this Tory exasperation and outrage is selective and transparently party-political. Rishi Sunak supports farmers’ protests against the Labour-run Welsh government, despite a disruptiveness to their campaign that he condemns in other activists. Desperate opportunism and inconsistency have always been his prime ministerial hallmarks.\nThe more revealing thing about the reaction of many MPs to the wave of protests is what it tells us about mainstream politics in general. Both the big parties are moving rightwards, having concluded that conservative voters will be decisive at the coming election. This shift means that our revered but often narrow representative democracy is representing the country as a whole even less well than usual – for example, the 45% of voters who believe Israel’s attack on Gaza is not justified. And so, when a parliament fails to speak for enough voters, politics takes other forms. In one sense, the Gaza protests, like the climate protests, are a highly public rebuke to the House of Commons, and a reminder of its limitations – of the things that most MPs cannot or will not say. No wonder many MPs wish the demonstrators would just go away.\nIn London, the protests have arguably been energised further by the built environment and atmosphere of Westminster itself. Britain has long been a democracy that centralises an unusually large proportion of political power in a tiny part of its capital, yet since the 1980s this enclave has become much more fortified. The official rationale is that it’s to deter terrorists, and in this the strategy has largely succeeded, but another consequence has been to separate MPs further and further from voters, behind layers of security barriers, bag scanners, surveillance cameras and armed police – while at the same time making Westminster feel ever more unwelcoming to non-insiders.\nInvading this space for a few hours as a demonstrator can feel excitingly transgressive and politically worthwhile in itself, and even more so when ministers and the rightwing media are blustering about your actions being outrageous, and trying to find ways to ban them. In the 1990s the American anarchist philosopher Peter Lamborn Wilson (writing under the pen name Hakim Bey) devised the concept of the “temporary autonomous zone” to describe fleeting but politically vibrant territorial occupations, in which “a guerrilla operation … liberates an area of land … and then dissolves itself to re-form elsewhere”. One common current protest chant is “Whose streets? Our streets!” In an age when many feel politically disempowered, the potential of such small victories to be formative experiences shouldn’t be underestimated.\nWhen and if the Tories go into opposition, it’s possible that they will suddenly develop their own appetite for street politics. During the most dominant phase of the Blair government in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance organised large marches in London, which became important rallying points for the Tories and conservative Britons in general.\nAwkwardly for today’s Tory critics of disruptive protest, the pro-hunting movement had a militant fringe, which compared itself to the IRA, and threatened acts of sabotage such as draining water reservoirs and even planting fake bombs. These militants received coded support from parts of the rightwing press, such as a Telegraph editorial in May 2002 suggesting that opponents of Labour’s rural policies should “take the gloves off”.\nTwo truths of our politics are that memories are short and the Conservatives are shameless. It’s not that hard to imagine Tory MPs and voters marching down Whitehall in protest at the policies of prime minister Keir Starmer, while the former prosecutor tries to silence them by taking the current Conservative anti-protest legislation even further. Some controversial Tories, such as the MP Miriam Cates, are already concerned about government plans to create a new, broader definition of extremism, and the restrictions it could place on the right as well as its enemies.\nOne day, more MPs will hopefully see protest as an essential companion to parliamentary politics, rather than its barely legitimate rival. But as the clampdowns keep coming, that day feels far off.\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"

        "headline": "Whoever forms Portugal’s government, this is a victory for the far right. Will Europe ever learn?",
        "teaser": "Sunday’s elections marked the end of voters’ patience with the failed socioeconomic policies of both main parties",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 16.40 CET",
        "content": "If the westernmost nation of mainland Europe was once seen as a paragon of sensible governance, it is now set for months or even years of political instability. Neither Portugal’s outgoing Socialists (PS) nor the centre-right Social Democratic party (PSD) were able to garner a majority in Sunday’s elections, ending the night barely one point apart and with a two-seat difference in the Assembleia da República. All eyes are now on the third force, the far-right party Chega (“Enough”), which quadrupled its parliamentarians from 12 to 48. Here is the real headline: an unprecedented victory for the far right in Portugal’s democratic history.\nSnap elections were called last November after the Socialist prime minister, António Costa, resigned after the launch of an investigation into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. (Costa was not accused of any crime, saying that while his conscience was clear, he felt he had no choice but to step down.) After more than eight years of eventful but unwavering leadership, the nation was left adrift. The opposition leader, Luis Montenegro, had been in place for just over a year when the government fell. The Socialists quickly, yet overwhelmingly, elected former infrastructure minister Pedro Nuno Santos to be their new leader.\nOn the campaign trail, both men proved similarly unimpressive, bordering on dull. Santos, known as a boisterous character, played the part of young but sensible leader. Montenegro wavered between platitudes and the inescapable shadow of Chega. Poll after poll, Sunday’s gridlock was long foretold.\nIt was one of those great ironies of history. Just short of 50 days before the 50th anniversary of the Portuguese revolution, which toppled an almost 50-year dictatorship, the nation woke up to nearly 50 newly elected far-right lawmakers in parliament. To give you a sense of Chega’s politics, it ran on a platform advocating the creation of a new crime of “illegal residence” on Portuguese soil and “reviewing” police regulations on the use of force. Pundits are now struggling to envision a governmental combination that does not include Chega. Montenegro has so far explicitly ruled out any deals with Chega because of what he calls the party leader’s “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic” views – the question is now how much strength is left in that cordon sanitaire.\nMany supporters of PS hoped for a repeat of 2015, when the Socialists came second in the election but successfully formed a government through a confidence and supply agreement with other parties. But this gangly coalition, aptly nicknamed the “contraption”, would be hard to reproduce today. The Communist party is weakened, with just four MPs now where it had 17 at the time. The anti-capitalist Left Bloc, which peaked in 2015 at 19 seats, now clasps on to the five it has had since 2022. The pro-EU Livre had more luck, going from one to four MPs. But, in total, the left fared badly, with just under 40% of the vote share.\nThe Chega founder and leader, André Ventura, branded the night “the end of the two-party system”. A catchy slogan, for sure, evocative not only of the party’s power as kingmaker, but also of the fact that Portuguese people have indeed grown tired of the two parties that have, alternately, governed the country since 1974.\nPS was not only fighting a war of attrition after eight years in power (marred by a series of influence-peddling and mismanagement scandals), but also fell short on its promises. Despite winning an absolute majority in 2022, the Socialists did little that could truly be called socialist. Between 2015 and 2019, PS conceded on a handful of simple social and economic demands from its far-left partners, while bolstering a limping economy with tourism revenues that injected much-needed cash but caused rents to spike, triggering an ongoing housing crisis.\nSince 2019, with two comfortable majorities, Costa successfully steered the ship during the pandemic but was unable to meet the demands of the economic aftermath of Covid. Minimum wage increases were never able to meet spiralling prices; rent controls were always out of the question. In a country where 12% are living in food poverty, people felt plundered, and while Costa’s replacement, Santos, led his campaign with a sort of mea culpa approach, to the electorate it felt like too little, too late.\nConversely, voters have also not forgotten about PSD’s last administration, from 2011 to 2015, which wrought hardship through a series of austerity measures that went from cutting pensions to abolishing bank holidays. Indeed, sightings of the former Conservative prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho on the campaign trail were received with frostiness and even heckling.\nChega’s success is the result of letting the beast of social discontent grow, feeding on the rapidly deteriorating living and working conditions. In a Portugal where incomes are the sixth lowest in the EU but “non-habitual residents” (read: expats) enjoy various tax exemptions, the most vulnerable are easy prey to an ultra-nationalist political project that promises higher wages and public spending but also lower taxes.\nA mere three months ahead of the European elections, democrats in Brussels should take notes from Portugal’s change in fortune. But maybe it is too late. The paradigmatic shift isn’t so much the end of the two-party system, but the end of the electorate’s faith in a socioeconomic model that has for many decades failed to sustainably deliver for the average working Jane and Joe. Last night, Chega was receiving messages of congratulation from far-right parties in Hungary, Spain, France and Germany. Democracies that fail to learn this lesson are doomed to open the door to the Chegas of the world.\nJoana Ramiro is a freelance journalist based in London and a contributor to the Portuguese news platform Setenta e Quatro"

        "headline": "Why British nightlife is shutting down – taking with it all its magic and messy glory",
        "author": "John Harris",
        "teaser": "A modern night out is a £180 Taylor Swift gig followed by a good night’s sleep. Meanwhile, the kind of venues where artists learn their craft are falling silent",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "An uneasy quiet is starting to settle on the UK, particularly at night. People still go out; millions of us still seem to have a deep fondness for nocturnal company, hedonism and noise. But this fundamental part of our culture may well be slipping away, for one very stark reason: the accelerated closure of clubs and music venues.\nEarlier this year, the Music Venue Trust (MVT), which exists to help and nurture grassroots establishments with an average capacity of about 300 people, published its latest annual report. In the course of 2023, it had registered the loss of 125 such venues, which had either gone out of business or stopped hosting gigs. The issues that tied everything together centred on soaring rents and energy costs, the economic slipstream of the Covid crisis, and the apparently mounting issue of disputes about noise abatement kicked off by people living in city centres, which were common factors all over the country. By way of illustrating their spread, the case studies in the report included venues in Liverpool, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Bath.\nThe latter city, it still pains me to write, has just lost a much-loved place called Moles, which took its name from a performance space that was literally and metaphorically underground. This was where, as a 20-year-old freelance music writer, I did my first big interview, with a long-lost band whose name now seems crushingly apt. They were a gnarly, Velvet Underground-esque quartet called The Perfect Disaster. Thirty-odd years after I nervously quizzed them in the venue’s back room and watched them play to a crowd of 200 before the obligatory indie disco, the MVT put Moles’ tragic demise down to “a huge increase in trade costs in the past 18 months, combined with a reduction in footfall in response to the cost of living crisis”.\nThe bigger story of music venues’ demise actually goes back much further. I first wrote about it in 2013 – and since then, the live music market seems to have split into two contrasting halves. Ticket prices for performances in stadiums and arenas are soaring, and vast new venues are planned for such cities as Cardiff, Edinburgh, Bristol, Sunderland and Dundee. But the kind of places where you can stand mere feet away from the performers, and catch a band or singer when they are just starting out, are being squeezed as never before.\nWhat distinguishes live venues from clubs is often unclear, but the latter are in an even more dire predicament. In August last year, it was reported that the UK had lost a third of its clubs in just three years – something once again linked to the pandemic, but also tied to how cities are changing, and a cultural snobbery and hostility that goes back decades. As if to prove it, last week’s budget included help for theatres and orchestras, but the dancefloors that have defined large chunks of the UK’s recent cultural history were apparently still beyond the pale.\nWhat we are losing here is partly about the seedbeds of an industry that remains one of the UK’s more successful exporters. Some people in the mainstream music business seem to think that alighting on the Next Big Thing in a club or venue is now a hopelessly old-fashioned notion, and that talent is more likely to be found on Instagram or TikTok. There is a grain of truth in that, but it doesn’t detract from how playing in front of small audiences can teach musicians the art of stagecraft, and allow them to find out who they are.\nEd Sheeran once played Moles, the Cockpit in Leeds (which shut in 2014) and Birmingham’s still-thriving Hare and Hounds. Seven long years before she swept this year’s Brit awards, the brilliant singer and songwriter Raye did her first headline performance at XOYO, a club and music venue in the Old Street area of central London. This year’s most touted band are the Last Dinner Party, who were inspired to get together by a scene centred on the Windmill, a 450-capacity place in south London; they have also played at Moles, as well as at small venues in Bristol, Brighton, Southampton and Manchester.\nFundamentally, though, this story is about everyday life, and what non-famous people do with the hours we set aside for pleasure. Trying to enjoy music in an arena, in my experience, is mostly a very unsatisfactory endeavour: a few bands and singers have the necessary self-projection skills, but far too many can’t cope with such cavernous surroundings. But for the audience, a night out in such a space goes with the modern grain of leisure time being pre-booked, precisely allocated and delivered with no glitches: you spend a small fortune on your e-ticket, turn up at the appointed time and get exactly what you expected.\nThe best nights spent at clubs and grassroots venues, by contrast, are often about chance occurrences. An unknown band could be crap, or brimming with genius. If they tick the second box and you go and see them again, you might be at the heart of a burgeoning community of early fans. In front of a small venue’s stage or in the whirl of a dancefloor, conversations might lead to new friendships. In both cases, there is something about the close proximity of other human beings that often brings us out of ourselves, and into experiences we didn’t know we were going to have.\nDo enough people still have an interest in any of that? Impossible living costs, not least among people under 40, have definitely made hitherto cheap nights out prohibitively expensive. But there might also be much deeper shifts at work. I sometimes wonder whether we are in danger of accepting a kind of social life designed by tech-centred minds that want everything to be scheduled, controlled and, to use a particularly horrible modern word, manageable.\nAlcohol is increasingly unfashionable. So, it seems, are recreational drugs. For those who can afford it, the glorious cacophony of city living must be quietened in line with the demands of work. Better to swipe our way to new relationships than find them by accident. On and on it goes: 21st-century heaven, perhaps, is a £180 Taylor Swift ticket followed by a good night’s sleep.\nSome of the economic aspects of our increasing night-time silence might be easily dealt with: the MVT says that tickets for shows in stadiums and arenas ought to be subject to a levy that would help the kind of small, independently run venues that might nurture tomorrow’s stars. The case for that is surely unanswerable. Whether or not we have a culture that understands all the messy joy and magic of those spaces is a much more troubling question.\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist"

        "teaser": "Whatever the Conservatives try, their huge deficit in the opinion polls isn’t shrinking",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 09.30 CET",
        "content": "The polls will tighten. The polls will tighten. The polls WILL tighten. This has been the drumbeat banging away in the background of British politics for a year or more. It is the soundtrack when Labour ducks into a defensive crouch despite the opposition’s soaring leads. It is the tune that Tories whistle to themselves rather than surrender to complete despair about what the voters are going to do to them at the ballot box.\nI have lost count of how many times I have heard angsty Labour people tell me that Sir Keir Starmer’s huge advantage in the opinion polls is bound to shrivel. This paranoia comes from Labour’s miserable track record of losing past elections it expected to win. It is further prompted by the desire to keep the party on its toes and disciplined. It is also the product of the belief, for which there is some evidence, that the electorate is much more volatile than it used to be. Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s director of campaigns, has an anti-complacency tool that he deploys against colleagues who assume that victory is already in the bag. He shows them a slide deck of election results over recent years, among them contests in Australia, America, Germany and Norway, in which there were dramatic shifts in voter support during the final leg of the race. He uses this to warn them that what the electorate are saying today is not a guarantee of what they will do in the polling booth.\n“The polls will tighten” is the mantra also to be heard from Tory people. It is the result of their yearning to find a reason to be cheerful accompanied by sheer disbelief that Labour can really be so far ahead. Many psephologists and pundits have been expecting the Tory deficit to narrow, because the history of previous UK elections tells us that incumbents often experience some kind of uplift when the moment of national decision comes into sharp focus. Full disclosure: I have been anticipating at least some degree of Tory recovery as we approach the election.\nAnd yet tighten is the one thing that the polls have resolutely not done. Since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, Labour’s lead in the poll of polls has sometimes been more than 20 points and it has rarely fallen much below that hefty advantage. There’s been the occasional dip to jangle Labour nerves and trigger brief episodes of false hope among Tories. But the overall message has been consistent.\nLabour’s towering headline lead is accompanied by an advantage on two key metrics. That is Sir Keir besting Mr Sunak as the preferred choice of prime minister, and Labour being rated superior for economic competence. If anything, the Conservative outlook has not brightened with the passing of time, it has grown more occluded as they have clattered closer to the buffers. The most recent tracker poll from Ipsos Mori, the oldest of the UK’s polling companies, puts the Conservatives on a share of just 20%, their lowest rating in the near half-century that Ipsos has been running this series. The previous Tory nadirs were 22% in December 1994 and May 1995, when John Major was en route to a landslide defeat in 1997. Rishi Sunak’s net approval rating is –54, a record low for him. He may think himself an expert at stacking the dishwasher but the voters are pointing him towards the waste disposal.\nThat’s one of the reasons I have been immune to the recent outbreak at Westminster of spring election fever. So long as they have road left to run, prime ministers do not willingly submit to a contest when they are being told that they will be crushed by the challenger. Another reason for my scepticism about a spring election is that Mr Sunak, who assumed office on 25 October 2022, has been at Number 10 for just 16 months. He will at least be able to claim he had two years as prime minister if he can make it to November.\nBetween now and an autumn election, the most dangerous point of the calendar for him is probably the May local government contests and their immediate aftermath. The Tories have become very accustomed to being thumped at the ballot box, but at this encounter with the voters they are highly likely to experience losses on a scale that will make some of their previous defeats look like a light slap on the wrist.\nAs my colleague Michael Savage points out, the council seats at stake were last contested in 2021 during the pandemic when the Covid cavalry was riding over the hill. The “vaccine bounce” helped the Tories to make significant gains – which means they have a long way to plunge this spring. Massive losses could conceivably trigger a putsch against Mr Sunak by Conservative MPs frantic enough to try changing leader yet again in the desperation to save their skins.\nSo no Tory more than the prime minister needed Jeremy Hunt to somehow contrive a gamechanger budget that would transform Conservative fortunes. “This had better work, because nothing else is,” one senior Tory remarked to me shortly before the chancellor got to his feet – only to disappoint those in his party looking for a miracle. It was foolish for them to invest big expectations in this budget because that required the chancellor to be a magician (which he isn’t) with lots of cash to splash (which he hasn’t).\nAny voter who found the budget make-believe even more implausible than usual was in expert company. Analysts are almost universally agreed that Mr Hunt peddled fiscal fantasies based on fictions about future spending and taxation that will unravel once we have got to the other side of the election. The main political takeaway is that the Conservatives remain wedded to the notion that cuts to headline tax rates are a potent way to beguile the electorate. The Tory punt is that this will induce voters to forget years of economic crisis and chaos while forgiving them for the fact that the average household will be worse off at the election than they were at the time of the last one. Mr Hunt’s brag that Britain is on track to become “the world’s next Silicon Valley” must have jarred with the millions whose living standards have been in Death Valley.\nBy choosing to lop two percentage points off national insurance, the chancellor set his face against all the polling, suggesting that most voters would have preferred him to prioritise spending on public services. Mr Hunt must think that a lot of people are lying to pollsters. In that respect, he has company within Sir Keir’s senior team. Many in Labour’s high command, especially those supervising election campaign strategy, distrust voters when they say they don’t fancy a tax cut. That’s why Labour did not oppose the reduction to national insurance announced last autumn and the further cut unveiled in this budget.\nObviously they understand that this will make it even harder for Rachel Reeves to fund repairs to the public realm and find money for other things a Labour government would like to do. That consideration is trumped by fear of handing a potential campaign advantage to the Tories along with a determination to hammer the Conservatives for putting taxes on a trajectory to take the largest share of national income since 1948.\nI haven’t had to look far to find Tory MPs doubtful that this budget will turn around their fortunes. “Hunt probably did as much as he could do in the circumstances, but it wasn’t enough,” one former cabinet minister remarks. “It’s not going to move the dial.” There’s supporting evidence for that view in the post-budget poll conducted by Opinium that we publish today. Far from voters being wowed, seduced or even mildly impressed, more than twice as many respondents rated it a bad budget as those who thought it good. One member of the cabinet, who is usually among its more upbeat members, sighed to me: “The electorate have basically decided that they’ve had enough of the Tories.”\nFor sure, a lot can happen between now and decision day. The economic record might not feel quite so rotten to some voters if household disposable incomes improve over the next six months. Labour could surprise us by committing an act of self-sabotage. There is some time left for the polls to shift. But after such a protracted period of the Tories trying and failing to budge them, we should entertain the possibility that the polls aren’t going to tighten much – and perhaps not at all.\n Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

I’ve only read the Qur’an in English – not in Arabic, as many Bangladeshi children do.\nInstead of learning Arabic verses, I was raised on a diet of Marx, Mao and liberation theology. My bedtime reading was Nehru’s Letters from a Father to a Daughter, written while he was imprisoned alongside Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence struggle.\nLike many men and women of their generation, my parents were freedom fighters in the Bangladesh war of independence. That war was not about religion; in fact, it was about rejecting an exclusively religious identity. When the British left India in two halves in 1947, they created a geographical impossibility of a country: Pakistan, irreparably divided between East and West, two halves whose people spoke different languages and had entirely different relationships to Islam.\nAs Bengali East Pakistanis, my parents, in the struggle for self-determination, privileged as primary their Bengaliness – their secular, cultural, non-religious identity. Today, Bangladeshis are, for the most part, devout Muslims – yet we celebrate cultural festivals whose symbolism and iconography are rooted in the syncretic tradition in which they were born.\nThe Bangladesh independence movement and the movement for the liberation of Palestine have always been allied. Our fates were similarly sealed in 1947, and between the exit of the British and the end of united Pakistan, we existed in parallel worlds. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, like the Awami League, was based on secular principles of national freedom. But in 1971 we achieved our freedom, and they did not. My father used to remind me of this fact as I was growing up – it was a trump card he would use whenever he imagined I was taking my freedoms for granted. “At least you have a country,” he would remind me. “I was born in East Pakistan; you were born in liberated Bangladesh. Imagine if you had been born in Palestine.”\nHis words have echoed profoundly for me in these past 156 days, as we have witnessed the unimaginable suffering of the people of Gaza. There is no language to encompass the 30,700 deaths, the obstruction of aid, the bombing of hospitals and refugee camps, and now the starvation of an entire population under siege.\nI have been lucky enough to have had two role models who demonstrated both religious devotion and a commitment to secular values of equality and justice. The first is my mother, who prays five times a day, but has just celebrated International Women’s Day by marching on the streets of Dhaka demanding an end to all forms of oppression against women. The second is her mother before her, who was widowed young and raised children against all odds, her faith a huge source of strength in her lifelong struggle against poverty and the invisibility of being a single mother.\nFor Islamic feminists, the Qur’anic vision of a religious community without a clergy, in which worshippers have a direct, unmediated, democratic relationship with God, is the basis for a faith that embraces gender equality. I love this interpretation, but in my own narrow experience of it, religion has not gone hand in hand with justice, and so I have shunned it. I resist being identified as a Muslim writer; I cringe when people refer to the Muslim world, as if such a homogenous, flattening thing exists. But this winter, as the people of Gaza have been subject to collective punishment, as the mothers of Gaza have held the shrouds of their children, I wonder if, perhaps, it is time to embrace my faith.\nThe month of Ramadan is about to begin. In my household in Dhaka, my parents will rise before dawn, eat a moonlit meal, and fast until sundown. Families will gather for the iftar meal; people will say the long tarawih prayers, their connection to their faith deepening with a global, collective experience of prayer and fasting.\nAnd yet, the Israeli minister Amihai Eliyahu, who has previously suggested Israel could use nuclear weapons in Gaza, has made a call to “wipe out” the month of Ramadan. This is only one small example of the systematic dehumanisation of Palestinians and a pervasive anti-Palestinian racism and Islamophobia that has been laid bare. The unprecedented levels of violence have been met, here in the UK, with attempts to criminalise dissent.\nBut this is not, and should not be, an issue of religious solidarity. My outrage at what is happening in Gaza – and the way we have been made to witness it mutely and without protest – does not come from a sense of solidarity with other Muslims. We should not be heartbroken over what is happening in Gaza because we are Muslims, but simply because we are human. If anything, recent events are reminders that commitments to certain identities, whether ethnic, religious, or national, can blunt our humanity, and blind us to institutionally sanctioned forms of violence. How else can we explain the continued bombing of civilians or a looming famine?\nIt would be a mistake to equate religious solidarity with basic humanity. As Kamila Shamsie has put it, this is the defining moral issue of our time, and we must, Muslims and non-Muslims alike – at Ramadan and at any time of the year – join hands in ending the violence.\nTahmima Anam is the author of The Good Muslim\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Lara Rodwell",
        "teaser": "Comments about our differences used to wound me. But then I was forced to confront my decades-long resentment",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "“Why are you fat, and why is she thin,” a puzzled middle-aged man asked, as my identical twin Katy and I strolled into a restaurant in central Mumbai for a post-yoga samosa. It wasn’t the first time we had been asked this question – but each time it hurt just as much, and stoked a decades-long resentment towards my sister, who was always being told she was better looking than me.\nAs children, we had relished in our identicalness and were joined at the hip. Physically, the only way people (even family members) could tell us apart was by our face shape. I had a slightly rounder face than Katy, with chubby cheeks that earned me the nickname Chipmunk growing up. Katy and I got the same grades, had the same interests, and on birthdays and Christmases got given identical gifts – but in different colours. We were inextricably “one”.\nBut when we were 13, the cracks began to show. At secondary school we begrudgingly agreed to be separated into different classes, forcing both of us to stand on our own feet for the first time. As the more naive sister, I trusted that our separation would be good for us in time – that it might help us to forge our own individuality within our closeness. Katy, on the other hand, struggled with her newfound independence.\nIt began with a skipped meal here and there, and an extra walk around the block at lunchtime. After a few months of restrictive dieting and obsessive exercising, Katy had started to lose weight, and a close family member noticed the stark difference in physical appearance between the two of us. Suddenly, we weren’t identical any more.\nOver the next seven years, Katy was in and out of psychiatric units across the country, being treated for anorexia. I expressed my grief through frustrated, teary outbursts where I begged her to “just eat, like a normal person”. I would visit her after school, at weekends and in the holidays, feeling abandoned, lost and rejected. We refer to this period of our life as the years we “hated each other”. I hated the fact I couldn’t live my life as a “normal” teenager, and she hated how much I hated her.\nAs Katy recovered, our relationship improved. But comments on our physical differences persisted, and they started to affect me. One guy at a party even dared to say to his friend, in earshot: “I’m more attracted to Katy because she’s thinner than Lara.” Our trip to India together had been about trying to repair our fractious bond and embark on yoga teacher training together – but the comments followed us there, too.\nI realised all the resentment I had been carrying for the past seven years was starting to express itself in a self-destructive and toxic way. I had started to hate myself. I felt less than, invisible, and defeated by my sister’s illness; as if I could never just be enough the way I am. I entertained fantasies that she would always be the more attractive, thinner twin that everyone rallied around. My self-worth had evaporated and I started to lose weight. For two years, we became competitors.\nBut when our dad died three years ago, it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I realised that life was too short to keep comparing myself with my sister, and tying my identity and self-worth to our identicalness.\nI read self-help books religiously to try to improve my body image and self-esteem, like Health at Every Size and Women Don’t Owe you Pretty. I listened to podcasts like Seems Like Diet Culture and ritualised cringe-worthy daily affirmations that I performed in the mirror.\nNow, when people comment on our differences, the result is night and day. Sometimes I still feel insecure, but there are more liberating moments, too, when I think, “Well, what’s wrong with being bigger than my twin sister, anyway?” It was only when I stopped feeling like the victim of other people’s judgments – which are ultimately out of my control – that I finally stopped comparing my weight, size and perceived attractiveness with my twin sister. In doing so, I was able to regain the self-confidence I once had, and finally allow our twinship to truly thrive.\nLara Rodwell is a freelance journalist and author\nIn the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

        "headline": "Ireland’s ‘no-no’ vote is a victory for human rights – not a rejection of progress",
        "author": "Niamh Ní Hoireabhaird",
        "teaser": "The government’s inept referendum campaign got the result it deserved. It’s time for a constitution that honours all our citizens",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 16.26 CET",
        "content": "As results from Ireland’s referendums began to trickle in, I cringed as I imagined the international headlines that would follow: “Ireland votes to keep women in the home” and “Referendums to modernise Irish constitution fail” were likely interpretations of the “no-no” vote.\nThis was the latest in a series of referendums that have seen Ireland progress into the 21st century. I’m sure the government felt that winning it would be easy, considering the success of the same-sex marriage and abortion referendums, which helped to earn Ireland a status as a beacon of liberal progressivism. But now I fear that, after Ireland’s recent flirtation with the far right, we’ll be seen as a backward country.\nOn Friday, International Women’s Day, Irish citizens took to the polls to vote in two referendums intended to modernise the country’s constitution, which has been in place since 1937. From the get-go, Ireland’s rightwing and conservative groups campaigned for no votes in both the family referendum and the care referendum.\nFor me and many others, a yes to the family referendum was a no-brainer: it proposed broadening the definition of a family beyond marriage to include those in “durable relationships”. But the care referendum was much more complex. The referendum proposed removing article 41.2, dubbed the “woman in the home” provision, and replacing it with wording that could see families saddled with the responsibility to provide care, while the state would “strive” to support them.\nIn its analysis of the amendments, the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) worried that the wording of the proposed amendment was “ineffective” and was “unlikely to provide carers, people with disabilities or older people with any new enforceable rights or to require the state to provide improved childcare, personal assistance services, supports for independent-living, respite care or supports for children with disabilities”.\nI resented the government for trading social inequalities, and replacing sexist language with ableist language. My identities as a woman and as a disabled person were in conflict.\nMy relationship with feminism has been a tumultuous one. As a disabled woman, my experience of inequality differs from that of my non-disabled peers. My younger brother and both I have the progressive neuromuscular condition Friedreich’s ataxia, so the concept of care plays a big role in our lives. His condition is much more advanced than mine, and he is 100% reliant on my parents and his nine hours of weekly government-funded care.\nFor able-bodied women, this referendum is about relieving an obligation to care – an obligation that women have been unfairly saddled with for centuries. But as a disabled woman, I need society to be more caring, not less. The failure of the yes campaign to even acknowledge this tension has been a great source of vexation for me over recent weeks. I felt that the rights of disabled people were being sacrificed by mainstream activists and NGOs who campaigned for a yes vote, ignoring the pleas of disabled people and carers.\nI worry constantly about my ageing parents, who are already struggling to cope with the physically laborious task of caring. What will happen to my brother as my parents get older? Who will take care of them in their old age? And what about me? I despair when I think about a future in which my husband is forced to give up his job, rely on carer’s allowance and dedicate his life to my care. I want to live an independent life, which only state-provided care can offer me.\nI felt the tide turning towards a no vote when an interview clip of Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, on Virgin Media One amassed huge popularity on social media. In the clip, Varadkar spoke about caring for his family members and said: “I don’t actually think that’s the state’s responsibility to be honest. I think it’s very much a family responsibility.” The outrage was immediately palpable online. Varadkar was eager to clarify his statement and claim that he had been misinterpreted, but the damage was done. The wording of the care referendum was perceived as yet another government failure over disability rights, the most recent of which was a “degrading and humiliating” proposal to reform welfare payments.\nVoters had their different reasons for choosing “no-no” on Friday. For many, their vote was against the confusing wording of the text or the haphazard conduct of the yes campaign, or simply against a government that has failed to deliver on health, housing and education. Some feminists rejected the proposals because they didn’t go far enough – and yes, some people will have voted them down because they want to keep women in the home. But the decisive defeat of the care referendum wasn’t a win for Ireland’s far right. Anyone who suggests that is glossing over the admirable work of disabled people, carers and their allies who want to hold the state accountable.\nThe government would be making a grave mistake if it underestimates the political appetite for change and chalks the result up to conservative groups. Instead it must recognise the public desire for true equality and progress rather than tokenistic referendums that divide activists and NGOs. I would be very happy to revisit a care referendum with a different text in the future, under a different government that respects the autonomy of disabled people. That would guarantee a yes from me.\nThe failure of the referendum is a victory for Ireland’s disability community, and I am relieved that Ireland did not vote to abdicate the state’s responsibility to care for its citizens. But the archaic language that defines women’s role as in the home will continue to sit in our country’s constitution until a government is willing to deliver equality for all. We take no comfort in that.\nNiamh Ní Hoireabhaird is a disability activist and journalist"

        "headline": "Eurovision mirrors how countries see one another. That’s why I can’t watch Israel take part",
        "teaser": "No amount of mental gymnastics can justify allowing its inclusion while a humanitarian catastrophe goes on in Gaza",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 08.00 CET",
        "content": "When I first moved to England for university, I took a course on the European Union. I remember my professor’s opening gambit was telling us that if we wanted to know how different countries felt about each other, we had to watch Eurovision. So like any good student, I sat down for my first Eurovision song contest in May 2016. Just a month before the UK voted to leave the EU, I watched as Joe and Jake placed a humiliating 24th out of 26 entries. Safe to say, I learned my lesson that evening.\nAfter that, Eurovision became a sacred viewing tradition among me and my friends – one that I must now give up. Instead of watching Eurovision this year, I will be joining the boycott of the song contest.\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, has given Israel the green light to compete. The EBU’s outrageous decision flies in the face of everything the song contest is designed to represent: peace, unity and cooperation. One in 20 people who were living in Gaza a year ago are now either dead, injured or missing owing to the actions of the Israeli state. How can a country whose assault on Gaza has so far claimed more than 30,000 lives be allowed to compete?\nIsrael’s participation in this year’s contest exposes the double standards and glaring hypocrisy embedded in the EBU’s opaque processes for defining what counts as “political”. Just one day after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the EBU banned Russian participation, stating that “in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry … would bring the competition into disrepute.”\nFor months, the EBU has been under increasing pressure to bar Israel from competing this year. Musicians from Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark and even Sweden (this year’s host country) have all signed open letters urging their respective national broadcasters to push for Israel to be banned. Iceland has also indicated it could withdraw from the contest entirely given the circumstances. Elsewhere, an online petition started in December aimed at the EBU’s director general has garnered almost 50,000 signatures.\nWhen the lyrics from Israel’s initial entry, October Rain, leaked in February, it looked as if – for the briefest moment – the EBU would refuse Israel a place. The EBU rejected the ballad as its verses seemingly contained references to the 7 October massacre by Hamas (which has been used by the Israeli government to justify the continuing assault in Gaza) and consequently breached Eurovision’s rules on political neutrality.\nAt first, Kan, Israel’s state broadcaster, was defiant and refused the EBU’s request to change the lyrics. The standoff was only broken when Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, intervened to work with Kan on changing the lyrics to suit Eurovision’s criteria. Now entitled Hurricane, the song has been approved by the EBU and so Israel will be in the competition this year. Though it’s surely mere coincidence that Hurricane rhymes with October Rain.\nWhile the EBU has put out statements trying to clarify why it treats Russia and Israel differently, the fact remains that the EBU has stayed painfully silent on the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. For many Eurovision fans, myself included, this isn’t just a missed opportunity. The EBU had an opportunity to step towards righting the contest’s historical wrongs. At the 2019 competition in Tel Aviv, Eurovision fined Iceland’s broadcaster after Hatari, the Icelandic entry, waved a Palestinian flag during the broadcast. The EBU also censored the band’s protest in the official DVD recording of the contest.\nThere is no moral or ethical way to watch Eurovision this year. No amount of mental gymnastics in my head can see it make sense. A boycott is the only option, and we must also go further. When Israel hosted Eurovision in 2019, an alternative Globalvision was organised by Palestinians in London, Dublin, Ramallah and Haifa on the same day to raise awareness of the occupation, but also to highlight “the original values of Eurovision, which is inclusion and diversity”.\nI hope that in the run-up to 11 May, these alternative Eurovision events will return and can be a place where we channel our energy and support. Venues that were planning on live screening the finale should instead consider hosting fundraising events for organisations like Medical Aid for Palestinians. Silence on this humanitarian crisis should be viewed as complicity – our actions matter more than ever.\nFor all of Eurovision’s pontificating about its apolitical nature, the contest has always been governed by political division and questions of inclusion and exclusion. Nowhere has that been clearer than in the incredibly moving shows and songs of support and solidarity for Ukraine over the past two years. Given Eurovision’s record, it’s hard to believe this year’s broadcast will allow any similar signs of support for Palestine.\nThe reality we are in is that both Russia and Israel are engaged in illegal invasions of other territories. Yet only one of them has been given the chance to perform on the world stage with more than 160 million viewers. Why is it that the value of “unity in music” only stretches to Ukraine? If we as Eurovision fans want to honour the competition’s spirit of peace and cooperation, we have no choice but to boycott.\nJeff Ingold is a freelance journalist covering LGBTQ+ issues, music and culture\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "Fat-shaming Keir Starmer was wrong, but we all judge people by their appearance",
        "author": "Sonia Sodha",
        "teaser": "What makes us believe in people we perceive as attractive, and can we ever break the habit?",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "Nobody could have predicted that Keir Starmer’s waistline would have become one of the talking points of budget week. But a throwaway comment by Peter Mandelson, the Labour peer, that he could do with shedding a few pounds paved the way for the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to poke fun at him in the Commons, and for shadow ministers to be quizzed over his weight.\nMandelson’s comments came in the context of a distinctly less personal critique of the dress sense of former Labour leaders; he recounted how he bought Tony Blair a collection of expensive, bright ties to project “boldness and confidence”. Ties are one thing, weight another: it’s rude to so publicly opine on a politician’s size, not that Starmer could really be labelled overweight.\nBut, like it or not, his general observation that appearance matters in politics is correct, and one no experienced adviser ignores. Of course, smartening up or losing excess weight won’t be enough to transform an unpopular leader into a popular one. But however unfair it is, the extent to which a politician is conventionally attractive plays into public perceptions.\nA study of gubernatorial elections in the US found that people’s rapid judgments of competence, based solely on the facial appearance of candidates, correctly predicted election outcomes much more than if appearance didn’t matter. Depressingly, experiments suggest that the faces perceived as most politically competent are more masculine as well as more attractive and mature.\nIt’s not just politics: on a media training course I did 20 or so years ago, we were told that what people take away from an interview is 90% what you look like, 10% what you say; a rule of thumb I can well believe. But the so-called “beauty premium” goes much further than the careers where appearance might be considered important: plenty of studies suggest that the more conventionally attractive someone is, the more likely they are to be paid more, get a job interview, and even get a more favourable outcome in a criminal trial.\nThis plays out differently according to sex; women are 16 times more likely to perceive they have been discriminated against based on their weight than men, for example, and research based on body scans of people’s overall shape suggests that, for men, it is being taller that pays off, whereas for woman it is having a lower body mass index. Women who show the visible signs of ageing are judged far more harshly than men.\nThe immediate question is: why? Is it because we’re innately attracted to and value people who are easy on the eye; is it because of the “halo effect” that occurs when our brains unfairly use appearance as a heuristic for other desirable traits; or is it because people regarded as attractive by society actually have valuable characteristics because of the way they’ve been socialised, having, for example, higher levels of self-confidence?\nIt’s hard to be definitive, but a Swedish study that looked at how engineering students were graded, first during real-world teaching, then in online teaching during the pandemic, found that there was a modest but statistically significant beauty bonus for students of both sexes before the pandemic, but that attractive female students lost 80% of this bonus after teaching moved online (it persisted for attractive male students). This certainly suggests a cognitive bias towards attractiveness.\nThe second big question is how much of our view of what makes for a desirable appearance is innate. That our view of what is beautiful is in large part culturally determined seems obvious: centuries ago, being fat was desirable; today, it is being slim.\nPrejudices about sex and race play into appearance-based perceptions – is it any surprise that more masculine faces are associated with competence in political leaders, given the harmful sex stereotypes reinforced on children from the get-go? But at least some of what we see as attractive appears to be there from birth: a number of studies have shown that babies prefer faces ranked as attractive by adults.\nLast comes the fraught question of how much we should be looking to unpick what could be described as “lookism”. It’s easiest when it comes to appearance bias associated with those characteristics against which it is plainly immoral and unlawful to discriminate, like sex and race. Making snap judgments based on someone’s genetic inheritance in relation to societal norms of beauty also feels wrong, and the same goes for weight, given there’s a genetic component to this too. But is it really unreasonable to react to how someone dresses, or how they take care of themselves, given how much many of us value self-presentation as an expression of our personality?\nThis is the aspect of appearance bias I find trickiest. I don’t want to live in a drab world where everyone dresses in grey and makeup is regarded as frivolous. As humans, we like aesthetically pleasing things. There is a joy in beautifying yourself through the way you dress, cut your hair, or wear makeup.\nBut not everyone enjoys it, and there is far more sexual objectification of women’s appearances. Social media influencers project unhealthy and unattainable standards of beauty to both girls and boys; research suggests that spending just seven minutes browsing Instagram feeds led to a decline in body satisfaction in girls, and body image issues are on the increase among young men too.\nIt feels like we live in a culture in which the emphasis on appearance is growing, and beauty norms are more and more unrealistic, determined by filters and tools that allow teenagers to do the kind of photo enhancement once the preserve of fashion magazines, and by an ever-lengthening list of cosmetic procedures and enhancements.\nThere is surely an aesthetic sweet spot. But it is precisely because so much of our appearances aren’t innate, but within our gift, that the beauty arms race is hard to call a halt on. There’s a hypocritical element to it all: I want the visible signs of female ageing to put woman at no less of a disadvantage than men, yet I won’t stop dyeing out my greys because I hate the way they look. The incentives not just to comply with societal expectations, but to actively enjoy doing so, are powerful, which makes that sweet spot very hard to find.\n Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Kenan Malik",
        "teaser": "Moguls extol the fruits of artificial intelligence, but seek to hide its science from public view",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 08.00 CET",
        "content": "In 1914, on the eve of the First World War, HG Wells published a novel about the possibilities of an even greater conflagration. The World Set Free imagines, 30 years before the Manhattan Project, the creation of atomic weapons that allow “a man [to] carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city”. Global war breaks out, leading to an atomic apocalypse. It takes the “establishment of a world government” to bring about peace.\nWhat concerned Wells was not simply the perils of a new technology, it was also the dangers of democracy. Wells’ world government was not created through democratic will but imposed as a benign dictatorship. “The governed will show their consent by silence,” England’s King Egbert menacingly remarks. For Wells, the “common man” was “a violent fool in social and public affairs”. Only an educated, scientifically minded elite could “save democracy from itself”.\nA century on, another technology provokes a similar kind of awe and fear – artificial intelligence. From the boardrooms of Silicon Valley to the backrooms of Davos, political leaders, tech moguls and academics exult in the immense benefits that AI will bring, but fear that it may also herald humanity’s demise as superintelligent machines come to rule the world. And, as a century ago, at the heart of the debate are questions of democracy and social control.\nIn 2015, the journalist Steven Levy interviewed Elon Musk and Sam Altman, two founders of OpenAI, the tech company that burst into public consciousness two years ago with the release of ChatGPT, the seemingly human-like chatbot. A galaxy of Silicon Valley heavyweights, fearful of the potential consequences of AI, created the company as a non-profit-making charitable trust with the aim of developing technology in an ethical fashion to benefit “humanity as a whole”.\nLevy quizzed Musk and Altman about the future of AI. “There’s two schools of thought,” Musk mused. “Do you want many AIs, or a small number of AIs? We think probably many is good.”\n“If I’m Dr Evil and I use it, won’t you be empowering me?” Levy asked. Dr Evil is more likely to be empowered, Altman replied, if only a few people control the technology: “Then we’re really in a bad place.”\nIn reality, that “bad place” is being built by the tech companies themselves. Musk, who stepped down from OpenAI’s board six years ago to develop his own AI projects, is now suing his former company for breach of contract for having put profits ahead of the public good and failing to develop AI “for the benefit of humanity”.\nIn 2019, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary to raise money from investors, notably Microsoft. When it released ChatGPT in 2022, the model’s inner workings were kept hidden. It was necessary to be less open, Ilya Sutskever, another of OpenAI’s founders and at the time the company’s chief scientist, claimed in response to criticism, to prevent those with malevolent intent from using it “to cause a great deal of harm”. Fear of the technology has become the cover for creating a shield from scrutiny.\nIn response to Musk’s lawsuit, OpenAI published last week a series of emails between Musk and other members of the board. These make clear that from the beginning all board members agreed that “OpenAI” could not actually be open.\nAs AI develops, Sutskever wrote to Musk, “it will make sense to start being less open. The Open in openAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after its [sic] built, but it’s totally OK to not share the science.” “Yup,” responded Musk. Whatever his lawsuit might say, Musk is no more open to openness than other tech moguls. The legal challenge to OpenAI is more a power struggle within Silicon Valley than an attempt to bring about accountability.\nWells wrote The World Set Free at a time of great political turmoil when many questioned the wisdom of extending suffrage to the working class.\n“Was it desirable, was it even safe to entrust [the masses],” the Fabian Beatrice Webb wondered, with “the ballot box, with making and controlling the Government of Great Britain with its enormous wealth and its far-flung dominions?” This was the question at the heart of Wells’ novel too – to whom could one entrust the future?\nA century later, we are again having a fierce debate about the virtues of democracy. For some, the political turmoil of recent years has been the product of too much democracy, of allowing the irrational and uneducated to make important decisions. “It is unfair to thrust on to unqualified simpletons the responsibility to take historic decisions of great complexity and sophistication,” as Richard Dawkins put it after the Brexit referendum, a sentiment with which Wells would have agreed.\nFor others, it is precisely such disdain for ordinary people that has helped create a democratic deficit in which large sections of the population feel deprived of a say in how society is run.\nIt is a disdain that feeds into discussions of technology too. As in The World Set Free, the AI debate centres around questions not just about the technology but also about openness and control. Despite the alarmism, we are a long way from “superintelligent” machines. Today’s AI models, such as ChatGPT, or Claude 3, released last week by another AI company, Anthropic, are so good at predicting what should be the next word in a sequence that they can fool us into imagining they can hold a human-like conversation. They are, however, not intelligent in any human sense, have negligible understanding of the real world and are not about to extinguish humanity.\nThe problems that AI poses are not existential, but social. From algorithmic bias to mass surveillance, from disinformation and censorship to copyright theft, our concern should not be that machines may one day exercise power over humans but that they already work in ways that reinforce inequalities and injustices, providing tools by which those in power can consolidate their authority.\nThat is why what we might call the “Egbert manoeuvre” – the insistence that some technologies are so dangerous that they must be put beyond democratic pressure and controlled by a select few – is so menacing. The problem is not just Dr Evil but those who use the fear of Dr Evil to protect themselves from scrutiny.\n Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"

        "published": "Sat 9 Mar 2024 18.07 CET",
        "content": "On my way to a recent march, I found myself feeling nervous. Sitting on the tube with my placard, its painted slogan calling for the release of hostages as well as a ceasefire, I realised I was avoiding people’s eyes and that my heart was racing. When I got out of the underground and heard the drums and the chanting, I wondered if I should have stayed home. As a Jew, was I safe?\nIf I had taken advice from Robin Simcox, the government’s commissioner for countering extremism, I would have stayed home. He stated last week that London turns “into a no-go zone for Jews every weekend”. He is following many others, such as the Telegraph’s Allison Pearson, who said that Jews were “too intimidated to venture into the heart of their own capital city”, or Simon Schama, who said the marches were “weekly public calls for their [Jewish] annihilation”, or the Jewish Chronicle’s Stephen Pollard, who also called London on Saturdays a “no-go zone for Jews”. Such comments really do stoke a sense of vulnerability.\nOn that day, once I joined the demonstration I realised that there was no need for me to feel nervous. I met up with a group of friends – from Jewish, Muslim and other backgrounds – and marched with them in the sunshine. It was much like any other big London demonstration, peaceful in the sense of being non-violent, but loud, crowded and passionate. It wasn’t fun, but nobody would have expected a march with such a purpose to be fun. And there were some revolting placards I saw afterwards on social media. But my initial apprehension that I might be walking into a situation where I would be unsafe was totally unfounded.\nThat’s not to say that the anxieties that Jews are feeling are misplaced. Not at all. Even before this war, there has been a terrifying rise of antisemitism among young people in the UK. Unhinged antisemitic conspiracy theories (hello Jewish space lasers) are strengthening online. In his London school, my teenage son has witnessed the kind of antisemitic behaviour – he calls it banter, I call it racism – that I believe would not have occurred a decade ago.\nKnowing this, we need calm discussion, evidence and education to ensure that the situation doesn’t get worse. What we don’t need is the kind of rhetoric that inflames division. Simcox’s comments make me feel much less safe. That’s not only because his statements are unfounded but also because he is using the pretext of Jewish fears to press for a further clampdown on the right to protest, which is already so eroded by recent legislation. His full sentence read: “We will not have become an authoritarian state if London is no longer permitted to be turned into a no-go zone for Jews every weekend.” Unpick the triple negative, and what you are left with is the aim to ban the protests, but because it’s ostensibly being done for our protection, we mustn’t call it authoritarian.\nLet’s be honest. Such desire to silence dissent is always authoritarian, whether in Britain or in Israel, where protest can result in loss of livelihood, arrest and imprisonment.\nIndeed, looking at the situation that protesters in Israel are facing, I feel it’s all the more important that Jews in London not only stand up for our precious rights to protest but also exercise those rights. I know that some British Jews have been bravely speaking up against Israel’s crimes for decades. But for too long, too many diaspora Jews have been too quiet. Indeed, I am ashamed that I have stayed mostly silent up to now. For me, as for many Jews, that silence often stems from the part that Israel has played in providing safety for my own family.\nMy grandmother Eva got out of Hamburg just in time, in 1939, with a precious domestic worker visa. She squeezed through a closing gate. Eva’s brothers had already made it out, a few years previously, to Palestine. And if they hadn’t? Undoubtedly they would have shared the fate of Eva’s parents, who were deported to Treblinka in 1942. That visceral knowledge of Israel as a necessary haven for my people has muffled my criticism for so long. Who am I, privileged descendant of one who fled west rather than east, to stand in judgment of other Jews who took the only route to safety that was available?\nBut there comes a time when silence is no longer tenable. There is a time when, even if we are grieving those killed and kidnapped and assaulted on 7 October, we cannot stand by as we see Israel piling horror upon horror. The images and voices of murdered and starving Palestinian women and children haunt our dreams just as the tales of the hostages do. Silence feels less like neutrality, and more like complicity.\nI know that I am coming into the debate late, and doing little, but if all I can do is raise a voice or a placard, I want to do it. And I know other Jews who are also experiencing a huge and painful change in their relationship to Israel, and either speaking up, or privately sending support for those who are speaking up, or thinking about speaking up.\nThe space where we are able to do so safely is a precious space. Let’s not give it up. Let’s protect it – and not just protect it, let’s use it, let’s enlarge it. Let’s say that as Jews we will not let our fears be used to clamp down on the rights to protest. And that we will no longer let our own sense of vulnerability be used to dehumanise others, not here, not there, not now, not ever.\n Natasha Walter is the author of Before the Light Fades: A Family Story of Resistance (Virago)"

        "headline": "For years, I saw sex as a competitive sport. Then I realised how empty I felt",
        "author": "Cornelia Holzbauer",
        "teaser": "I am still a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community, but I am happier since giving up casual encounters",
        "published": "Mon 4 Mar 2024 10.00 CET",
        "content": "Until recently, I used sexual encounters the same way others might a glass of wine after a long day, or some chocolate after a meal – before you know it, one glass can quickly turn into two or three, or a chocolate bar a day.\nHaving been single for almost five years, I found myself increasingly viewing sex as a competitive sport. It became a means to an end – an orgasm, a stress relief, a cure for boredom or loneliness. One time, I joked with my friends that I “masturbated with his body”, referring to my latest conquest.\nI had been keenly aware of my casual approach towards sex for a while, but I didn’t see it as a problem – I was never addicted to sex and had long been a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community. I lived by the mantra: “Singles deserve intimacy, too.”\nIn hindsight, it’s clear that I was confusing sex with intimacy. I thought: “Just because I am not in a relationship, doesn’t mean I don’t get to have all the sex my heart desires.” But what started as an empowered “I am different, I wear my nymphomania as a badge of honour” journey soon snowballed into saying “yes” when I should have really said “no”.\nLast summer, I slept with a man with whom I had a rare, electric chemistry. But at 7am, after about four hours of sleep, he woke me rudely and asked me to leave – he told me he “couldn’t sleep” while I was there. I gathered my stuff and left, after asking him to book me an Uber. Five minutes into the ride, the driver informed me it had been cancelled. When I called the man to ask what had happened, he said I “had been cold to him” upon my departure. My jaw fell to the floor as I found myself stranded somewhere in Upper Manhattan.\nLast autumn, I met a man via a dating app and slept with him on the first date. After we were done – it was already 3am – he declared that he’d have to go home now. Taken aback, I inquired why he wouldn’t just stay over and leave in the morning. His response: “Sleeping next to a woman is too intimate. I’d risk her falling in love with me.”\nI can think of at least 10 more similar situations where I felt belittled, sidelined, slut-shamed or all of the above. But what haunts me the most is that I know I have done the same to some of my sexual partners in the past. My numbness led me to believe that this was normal behaviour in the jungle that is otherwise known as casual sex among singles.\nMy unhealthy relationship with sex came to an unceremonious end with the help of social media and a good cry. In November, inspired by the social media trend “Dating Wrapped”, where singles post slideshow presentations summing up their year of dating, I counted the number of people I had bedded in the last year – 20. I was shocked by the relatively high number, considering almost none of them had made me feel fulfilled, excited or empowered.\nMany of those encounters had been so forgettable that I had trouble recalling how I felt during or after, or found myself zoning out and thinking of something else while doing the deed. I had sometimes said “yes” to sleeping with someone simply because they asked, even if I wasn’t attracted to them.\nLooking back, there was no one big lightbulb moment that led me to quitting casual encounters. (That might not have worked anyway; going cold turkey after years of bingeing may lead to relapses.) But sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner table surrounded by my happily married parents and my sister, her fiance and toddler, I found myself sobbing uncontrollably. The juxtaposition between my life and theirs suddenly dawned on me: “I can’t remember the last time someone I liked held my hand or hugged me.”\nI knew I needed to stop having sex with anybody other than myself – a realisation born out of pure exhaustion. I now have one rule for my current existence: I won’t sleep with anyone for whom I don’t have romantic feelings. It’s been almost four months since I had a sexual encounter (what I used to call a “dry spell”), and I am feeling cleansed. The “sugar” and “toxins” are leaving my body – or rather, my mind – and I am clear and focused. It’s a whole new world for me, and I feel excited, dedicating the time I used to spend recruiting my next lead, and later crying to my therapist, on my career instead.\nOf course, there are withdrawal symptoms. They usually kick in when I encounter a sex scene in a TV show or movie, or when I witness a friend going home with someone after a night out. But I am starting to realise that sex is not a numbers game and that intimacy and sex can be entirely different things.\nWhile my body is closed for business, my heart is open for romance.\nCornelia Holzbauer is a health and wellness journalist based in New York City\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Torsten Bell",
        "teaser": "The chancellor’s choices mark a shift in Conservative policy. For once, older people are not given priority",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 08.30 CET",
        "content": "The budget hasn’t moved the polls. They never do. But it may mark a change in politics. Why? Because it didn’t prioritise pensioners. The chancellor announced the second 2p reduction in the basic rate of national insurance in just four months, and 4p off NI is a big win for workers, who gain up to £1,500 next year.\nBut the picture of winners and losers is complicated because cuts today follow big tax rises – not least the six-year freeze to tax thresholds that will raise £40bn a year.\nPensioners are hit by those freezes, but don’t benefit from NI rate cuts, leaving Britain’s 8 million taxpaying pensioners an average of £1,000 out of pocket. This is surprising because age has replaced class as the biggest divide in our politics – and pensioners are the Conservatives’ core vote: in 2019, 70-year-olds were more than twice as likely to vote Conservative as those aged 30. There’s a reason George Osborne introduced the state pension triple lock, even as benefits for younger families were slashed.\nThere’s a strong case (leaving aside whether they are affordable) for focusing tax cuts as Jeremy Hunt has: pensioners don’t benefit from the NI cut as they are already exempt from the tax. Plus pensioners’ relative economic position has been transformed; the share of pensioners in poverty has halved since 1990. For the first time in history, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the rest of the population.\nThe state pension will rise by 8.5% in April and the triple lock remains. But the budget choices are a big shift – whether intended or accidental - for the Conservatives. Maybe they’ve realised having an offer for working Britain is a good idea. Crazy thought, but perhaps some houses will get built next.\n Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation and author of the forthcoming book Great Britain?

        "teaser": "Presidential elections this week are a sham, but they must not demoralise those who dare to imagine a Russia without Vladimir Putin",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 19.30 CET",
        "content": "Article 13 of the Russian constitution promises political pluralism. Article 29 guarantees freedom of speech. It is a brave citizen who insists on those rights.\nAlthough Russia will hold a presidential election at the end of this week, the result is a foregone conclusion. Vladimir Putin will win comfortably. The spirit of post-Soviet democratisation is all but dead. The flame is kept alive by a courageous few.\nThousands turned out at the Moscow funeral of Alexei Navalny, the jailed opposition leader generally assumed to have been murdered by order of the Kremlin. There were chants calling for “Russia without Putin”. That is high-risk activity. Open dissent against the regime is punishable by fines and prison sentences. OVD-Info, a human rights group, has catalogued hundreds of detentions in dozens of cities after vigils in honour of Mr Navalny.\nIt has been the largest show of opposition since the invasion of Ukraine, but the numbers are not huge for a country of 144 million. What the majority of Russians think about their president and his war is opaque. Opinion polls show majorities in favour of both, but it is hard to conduct accurate surveys in a climate where deviation from the official line is legally proscribed.\nIndependent analysts say the picture is nuanced – a spectrum of sentiment with ideological pro-Kremlin conviction shading into looser patriotic sympathy with the army and then degrees of apathy, low-level discontent, grim resignation, despair and a kernel of committed anti-regime activists.\nMr Putin’s position is secured by brute force and cultivated disbelief that any alternative is viable. He achieves this by eliminating rivals and propagating a personality cult that depicts Russia as the target of a foreign dismemberment plot and himself as the only person able to hold the country together. This speaks to a deep-rooted national anxiety about the Motherland unravelling in chaos. Something like that happened recently enough for older generations in particular to see democracy as a risk not worth taking.\nThis week’s election is not meant to fool anyone into thinking that Russians have a choice. It is a ritual affirmation of incumbent power, a pastiche of democracy to demoralise those who dream of peaceful regime change. But even the pretence of a ballot gives the opposition something to rally around. Yulia Navalnaya, the murdered dissident’s widow, has called for anti-Putin voters to converge on polling stations at midday on Sunday even if they don’t intend to vote. The point is to be visible. The authorities can hardly ban such gatherings when they are laying on the election.\nThese are wholly symbolic gestures, but that doesn’t mean they are futile. Russians who dare to speak up for democracy, and those who silently crave the end of Mr Putin, need reminding that they are not alone. There is a role also for those outside Russia who can amplify voices of courage and hope. There are jailed opposition figures – Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza – at risk of suffering the same fate as Mr Navalny. The more conspicuous their plight, the harder it is for Mr Putin to pretend his is the only vision of Russian politics.\nThe freedoms that are promised in Russia’s constitution feel remote today, as this week’s election will sadly demonstrate. But it will show also that the spirit of opposition cannot be extinguished."

        "headline": "The Observer view on Joe Biden’s bravura performance in his State of the Union address",
        "teaser": "The US president demonstrated that there is plenty of fight left in him, but he’s going to need it",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 07.30 CET",
        "content": "Joe Biden drove up to Capitol Hill last week to deliver his final State of the Union address to Congress before November’s pivotal US election with public expectations at rock bottom. He returned to the White House a few hours later with all flags flying and the cheers of grateful (and relieved) Democrats ringing in his ears. Biden had survived what could easily have turned into a wake for his unpopular presidency. More than that, he had scored a personal mini-triumph which, for now at least, has boosted faith in his ability to win a second term.\nThe reasons so little was expected of Biden are not difficult to discern. He is 81 and many Americans – 73% of all registered voters, according to one recent poll – believe he is too old to be an effective second-term president. Even among Democrat voters, confidence has slipped since 2020. Only 28% are enthusiastic about his candidacy, while 38% think the party should pick someone else. Views of Donald Trump, 77, the likely Republican nominee, are barely more positive. About 42% of all registered voters say he is too old.\nThe age factor is but one of many worries for Biden’s re-election campaign. Only one in four voters believes he is leading the country in the right direction. Opinion polls consistently show an across-the-board loss of support among voters classed by education, race and gender. And a majority is critical of Biden’s handling of the economy – always the biggest issue – despite record high employment figures, falling inflation and hopeful signs, for him, of an accelerating pre-election recovery. Nationally, Trump currently leads by an average of two points.\nYet if Biden had a hill to climb, physically and politically, as he made his way up to the Capitol, it was not reflected in a combative, bravura performance. Biden is a veteran of these set-piece events and refused to be thrown by fierce Republican heckling. Instead, he confronted the age question head-on. “The issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are, it’s how old are our ideas,” he said. “Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas. But you can’t lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back. To lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future.”\nThe line about revenge and retribution was one of numerous, not so subtly veiled references to Trump, to whom Biden referred throughout as “my predecessor”. It was as if the very name of the man who has spent the past four years calling him a liar, a fraud and an election cheat stuck in his craw. That’s no surprise. Biden hammered home his view that the threat posed to democracy, in America and around the world, by Trump and his fanatical Maga movement was basically no different from that posed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, following his illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine could win the war, Biden insisted, if it was given the military support it needs – but that meant ending the stalemate in Congress over additional US aid. Yet Trump simply didn’t care. He had told Putin to “ ‘do whatever the hell you want’… I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous, and it’s unacceptable,” Biden said. Defending “freedom and democracy” will be one of his signature themes this autumn.\nAgain and again, Biden turned his wrath and scorn on Trump and the Republicans. One by one, he picked on other issues that, if he has his way, will define the election. Foremost among them were the 6 January insurrection, the evisceration of abortion rights by Trump-appointed supreme court justices, Republican support for tax cuts for big business and the wealthy, the party’s opposition to meaningful gun controls and its cynical blocking of a law to curb migration along the Mexican border.\nYet for many Americans and a watching world, there was disappointment that Biden’s passionate outrage did not extend to the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, although he tried hard to sound indignant. Having previously questioned the figures, he endorsed the total of 30,000 Palestinian dead, “most of whom are not Hamas”. The US would build a pier off the coast to facilitate aid supplies, he said. He was working hard to establish “an immediate ceasefire that would last for six weeks”. But there was no initiative to end the war, no real criticism of Israel’s actions, no measures to oblige it to desist. For Biden, Israel is a blindspot, lethal for Palestinians and potentially deadly, too, for his re-election hopes.\nMore campaign event than constitutional ritual, this was not a typical State of the Union address. Biden was frequently interrupted in mid-flow yet he seemed to relish the knockabout, serving up rhetoric and mockery with equal gusto and avoiding trademark gaffes. This rude, raucous occasion accurately mirrored the overall state of American society: divided, partisan, angry, discontented. It’s a society where people appear to have largely stopped listening to opposing views and arguments.\nBiden is a conviction politician. Unlike the dissimulating, unprincipled Trump, he believes strongly in what he says and the values he espouses. Yet Biden is a performer, too. He used Congress as a stage to demonstrate, primarily to watching TV viewers, that there is plenty of fight left in the old dog. His bottom-line message: old or not, like me or loathe me, I’m the guy you need at a time of acute national peril. Will the voters buy it a second time?

        "teaser": "Rejecting green transport policies was a backwards step by Rishi Sunak. New research proves it",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 19.25 CET",
        "content": "It should be a no-brainer. In a country where 63.8% of adults are overweight, millions of people do not take the minimum amount of recommended exercise, and air pollution is a serious risk to health, encouraging walking and cycling rather than driving short distances is good public policy. All over the world, but particularly in rich, western countries such as the UK, where populations are ageing and healthcare costs are rising, boosting public health and preventing illness should be aims shared by all. As well as their local impacts, cars are a big contributor to global heating and in 2021 were responsible for 57% of the UK’s transport emissions.\nBut ever since the Conservatives pulled off a narrow victory in last year’s Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection, aided to some degree by their opposition to the expansion of Sadiq Khan’s ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez), Rishi Sunak’s government has performed an about-turn. A preference for private over public transport has long been a feature of rightwing politics. But under Boris Johnson, a combination of public health and climate goals convinced the party to back schemes aimed at discouraging unnecessary driving. In 2020, ministers made new funding available for low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) because of the need for safe alternatives to trains and buses during the pandemic. In London, an unprecedented expansion led to 300,000 people finding themselves living in an LTN within six months.\nNot every scheme worked. In some places, implementation was rushed and preparation inadequate. As with other new systems, perhaps especially ones that rely on behavioural nudges, transport arrangements need to be tried out. But the vast majority of projects launched four years ago are still in place, and three pieces of new research reveal the shocking extent of the government’s error in setting its face against cleaner, healthier cities – in favour of an irresponsible pledge to ditch “anti-car measures”.\nOne study commissioned by Mr Sunak himself, and buried before being leaked to the Guardian, showed that LTNs in Birmingham, York, Wigan and London had an average of 45% support and 21% opposition – putting to rest the myth of their unpopularity. Meanwhile, an investigation led by Prof Rachel Aldred showed that average walking and cycling levels increased substantially in three London boroughs where LTNs were introduced. The third report, on London’s air quality, reveals that roadside pollutant levels have fallen dramatically since the Ulez was introduced – offering a boost to Mr Khan before May’s mayoral election.\nAlready, some European cities are streets ahead of the UK in their ambitions for pedestrianisation. But a recent upsurge in antipathy to the concept of “15-minute cities” – where people spend more time where they live and less time commuting – has tipped into paranoia in some quarters. Ministers should have known better than to legitimise such fears. In stoking hostility towards Labour-run councils that are trying to make cities healthier and more habitable, Mr Sunak has set his country back.\nThe reality is that ubiquitous satellite navigation has undermined decades of urban planning – by directing traffic down roads not built for it. LTNs, along with other clean air measures, are part of the solution to pollution and congestion and the harm caused by sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets. Judging by the evidence, and to the credit of the councils that run them, they are succeeding."

        "headline": "The Observer view: Michelle Donelan deserves to lose her job",
        "teaser": "The science and innovation secretary falsely accused two academics with whom she disagreed of holding extremist views",
        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "Conservative ministers have in recent years bullied civil servants, been criminally sanctioned for breaking the law and sent restricted material to those unauthorised to receive it. Now there is a new misdemeanour to add to the list: the science and innovation secretary, Michelle Donelan, has had to pay damages and apologise to two academics after they launched legal action, accusing her of libelling them.\nLast October, Donelan wrote to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a non-departmental umbrella body that oversees seven higher education research councils, Innovate UK and Research England, to complain about two members of the latter’s new equality, diversity and inclusion expert advisory group. She accused the two academics of “sharing extremist views on social media”, expressed her “disgust and outrage” at their appointment, and asked UKRI’s chief executive to disband the working group.\nExcept that neither academic shared extremist views on social media. One tweeted a Guardian news story with the headline “Suella Braverman urges police to crack down on Hamas support in UK” with the comment “this is disturbing”. It seems Donelan implausibly interpreted this as a comment on the sentiment in the headline not the news story. The other stood accused of “amplifying” a post that condemned violence on both sides but made reference to Israel’s “genocide and apartheid”, a view that may cause offence to some but which is certainly within the bounds of legal speech.\nUKRI responded by suspending the two academics and conducting a full investigation. Its report, published last Tuesday, found no evidence that either academic had shared extremist material or supported a proscribed terrorist organisation; no failure on their part to uphold the principles of public life; and no grounds to remove either from the working group. Donelan has publicly apologised; and the government stumped up £15,000 in agreed damages.\nQuite apart from the financial cost to the taxpayer, this is a case of a minister unfairly impugning two academics because she disagrees with them. Muddying disagreement with support for extremism has reputational consequences for the people in question, and, more broadly, will have a chilling impact on other academics who hold similar views. It undermines academic freedom in the university sector, and is symptomatic of a government with a low tolerance for free expression and dissent. As we reported last year, there is evidence of 15 government departments monitoring the social media feeds of their potential critics in order to prevent them from speaking at government-funded public events.\nExtraordinarily, this is a government that also claims to champion academic freedom. Ministers are right that there are issues in higher education: several academics, for example, have experienced bullying or lost jobs as a result of their mainstream gender-critical view that sex cannot be replaced by self-identified gender.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 will have its intended effects; culture change can be difficult to effect through legislation. But ministerial hypocrisy is actively undermining it.\n“Free speech for me but not for thee” is the sentiment that characterises much of the debate on free expression. But citizens have a right to expect government ministers to uphold free speech rights for everyone. A science and innovation secretary who uses her position to falsely denounce academics as holding extremist views cannot continue in post; she should resign or be sacked.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "Congratulations, Rupert Murdoch! Let’s hope this love match lasts longer than TalkTV",
        "author": "Marina Hyde",
        "teaser": "This is the media mogul’s second proposal in 12 months. We mortals can only speculate about his mesmerising dating secrets",
        "published": "Fri 8 Mar 2024 14.54 CET",
        "content": "At last, some happy news. Rupert Murdoch is engaged – and for the second time in less than a year. I know! Despite being 93 next Monday, he’s getting engaged even more frequently than serial sex killers serving life sentences. Those betrothals, of course, tend to happen entirely by letter, but as far as we know, Murdoch’s latest love match is a real-world union. His fiancee is Elena Zhukova, 67, a retired biologist who also previously served as mother-in-law to Roman Abramovich. In the absence of an official engagement photo, just sub in that image from Alien 3 where the slavering alien corners Ripley in the infirmary. And please remember – the Fox News chairman emeritus’s lifelong commitment to irreverent stories about people’s private lives means the above is precisely how he wants his latest chapter to be covered.\nAs mentioned, this is Murdoch’s second proposal inside 12 months, his previous engagement enduring just a fortnight. Hand on heart, I was surprised he couldn’t make it work with that last one, a former dental hygienist/evangelical prison chaplain he met in one of his gardens, who had successfully dismissed a case of “financial elder abuse” brought by one of her previous stepchildren. She seemed so perfect. Back at the time they announced their intention to wed (not hugely long after Rupert reportedly told Jerry Hall via email that he was divorcing her), he gibbered out some hilarious interview to his own New York Post, in which he claimed: “I dreaded falling in love – but I knew this would be my last.”\nAnd yet Murdoch has now faced those fears not once but twice – and all in less than half the TV broadcast lifespan of his disastrous TalkTV channel, which this week announced it was moving to online only. (Something about being “brave”, which felt quite “brave” in itself, given the calamitous rating circumstances.)\nSo what do we know of this new love match? One of these most recent fiancees was 66, while this latest is 67, suggesting that Murdoch’s current romantic sweet spot is around the age of his eldest daughter (66). Perhaps mindful of a potential clash with the still-unscheduled nuptials of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez, he and Zhukova have announced their wedding will take place in June. The location will be Rupert’s Moraga vineyard in California, which is the same one Jerry Hall says he made her do a 500-hour online winemaking course for, so he could write off $3m in expenses. I wonder if he ever put his finger on why that last marriage didn’t work out? Perhaps there were clues in the CCTV images from her home that continued to be beamed back to Fox HQ after their split, until Mick Jagger’s security team dismantled the cameras.\nAnyway, all ancient history now. And clearly, the next Mrs Murdoch has already pulled off a superior tactical manoeuvre to his last fiancee, who was scheduled to marry him at the less optimal age of 92. God forbid this engagement falls apart too, but if it does, current rate of acquisition would suggest a next fiancee could pick up Murdoch at the even more desirable vintage of 94. Wife number seven or eight would expect to hit sometime around the 100 mark. In some ways, the dream.\nBut on now to how the happy couple met. According to the Daily Mail, which last August broke the news of their romance, they were introduced by Murdoch’s last but one wife, Wendi Deng. Murdoch remaining friends with Wendi feels quite the shakedown, given one detail of the Vanity Fair article that came out last spring. In this epic tale of messy billionairedom, covering the past few years of upheaval in his family and business empire, there was an episode where Murdoch had a fall which – to cut a long and absolutely batshit story short – eventually saw him medevac-ed from a Guadeloupe superyachting mishap to LA. There, doctors examining his X-ray discovered he had not only broken his back, but had also previously fractured vertebrae. As the magazine elaborated: “Murdoch explained it must have been from the time his ex-wife Deng pushed him into a piano during a fight. (Ms Deng did not respond to requests for comment.)”\nRighto. We don’t know whether Ms Deng responded to requests to source her ex a new wife – she could just be a self-starter with initiative to burn – but it’s good the former couple were able to put the piano spinal behind them. As for what caused the instrument to become caught up in one of their fights … Speaking purely speculatively, perhaps it was just nearby when Rupert was confronting Wendi over an earlier Vanity Fair article, in which two notes reportedly written by Deng were reproduced. One concerned former Google CEO Eric Schmidt; the other our own Mr Tony Blair. “Oh shit, oh shit,” ran this latter one. “Whatever why I’m so missing Tony. Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt … [sic; it’s all sic] And he is slim tall and good skin. Pierce blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes. Also I love his power on the stage … and what else and what else and what else …”\nSuch very funny people, and miles more entertaining than most of the ones you’re allowed to read about in his newspapers. Indeed, now he’s retired/meat-puppeting his son Lachlan from the vineyard C-suite, perhaps Rupert is asking himself “and what else and what else and what else”. Could he not at least consider writing a dating book for mortals, in which he shares his increasingly mesmerising romantic secrets?\nMarina Hyde is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "teaser": "Keir Starmer’s party should make councils sustainable, bring local transport into public control – and build new universities",
        "published": "Thu 7 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "Of all the promises made by Conservative politicians over the past 14 years, the pledge to convincingly reduce the UK’s regional inequalities has turned out to be the most empty. George Osborne came up with the idea of the “northern powerhouse”. Theresa May talked about somehow getting “our great cities firing on all cylinders to rebalance our economy”. Boris Johnson enthusiastically inflated the same ideas with his trademark brand of hot air, and tantalisingly floated them over the kind of post-industrial places that switched from Labour to the Tories in 2019. But beyond a few promising spurts of devolution to metro mayors and tiny pots of regeneration funding, hardly anything changed. That so many councils are now facing bankruptcy compounds the sense that the “levelling up” drive was something close to a scam.\nThis does not, of course, invalidate the basic idea. The UK – and England in particular – remains absurdly centralised and riven by a yawning economic gap between London and the south-east, and just about everywhere else. If a new government is going to create a new kind of country, this is where a lot of its focus should fall. My advice to them is as follows:\nThe English councils that run local services, from social care to leisure centres, are in the midst of cuts, savings and council tax rises aimed at filling a financial gap put at around £4bn. Unless something drastic changes, another austerity drive will loom next year, and the year after that. Whatever the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, says about an incoming Labour government’s parsimony, the hole needs to be sustainably filled. She might find a few tax loopholes to close; she could just as easily take inspiration from the wealth tax proposed by Labour MP Liam Byrne, a 1% tax on wealth over £10m. This would hit around 20,000 people and bring in up to £10bn a year.\nTo ease the pain of councils’ current annual rush to balance their books, Labour seems to be seriously considering enabling councils to set their budgets over “multi-year” cycles – which is a very good idea, but only a small part of what needs to change. Reeves has spurned fiscal devolution, but letting local and regional areas keep a share of, say, VAT and income tax is an idea whose time has surely come. There is one more change that is screaming out to be made: the radical remodelling of council tax. Outdated and unfairly regressive, a Keir Starmer/Reeves government could base any reform on the changes currently being planned in Wales.\nThe greatest single success of England’s limited devolution programme has been the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham’s decision to bring bus services into public control. This needs to become the norm and the same model ought to be extended to other aspects of public transport – for example, the tangle of often unreliable railway branch lines that serve cities and extend into our suburbs and shires. We should rebrand them – à la London’s Overground – and put services and stations under local control. That would open the way to a miracle that Europeans take for granted but Britons still think of as fanciful: integrated local transport. Can you imagine?\nWhile we’re on this subject, a new government ought to symbolise its push to upgrade transport outside London by allowing at least one big city to create a new transit system, financed by a bond issue. Because I love the place but am endlessly frustrated by how maddening it is to get around, I nominate Bristol – which needs something like either Newcastle’s longstanding Metro or Manchester’s trams.\nManchester proves it: successful modern cities build their economies around thriving universities, a realisation that ought to boot aside a lot of the illusions and half-measures that have so far passed for levelling up. We ought to create four or five new institutions of higher education with a focus on technology and green industry, and situate them in places that could do with the resulting economic boost. The growing tech cluster in the north-east might make Sunderland a perfect potential site. I’d also nominate Stoke-on-Trent, ideally located as it is next to the M6 and equidistant from Manchester and Birmingham.\nIn Wales, Newport or Swansea would be worthy contenders. In the east of England, I’d suggest Ipswich. To celebrate Scotland’s long history of industrial innovation – and boost an area once known as Silicon Glen – why not build a university in Livingston? Then offer incentives to startups in those areas to encourage graduates to stay. If that kind of idea sounds far-fetched, it’s a measure of how meek and unambitious levelling up has so far proved to be, and why it urgently needs to be revived and reinvented.\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist"

        "headline": "For years, I suspected MI5 interfered in the miners’ strike. The truth was even more shocking than I thought",
        "teaser": "A document buried in the National Archives reveals how the security service abused its power to help the government win",
        "published": "Thu 7 Mar 2024 13.26 CET",
        "content": "MI5 has always carefully guarded its secrets. In her memoir, the ironically titled Open Secret, the former head of the security service Stella Rimington assessed the role of MI5 during the 1984-85 miners’ strike: “We limited our investigations to the activities of those who were using the strike for subversive purposes. The reports we issued to Whitehall during that time were most carefully scrutinised to ensure they referred only to matters properly within our remit.”\nThis was the official version of events. Yet buried in the National Archives at Kew is a secret document that casts new light on Rimington’s account of MI5’s role during an industrial dispute that represented the most serious challenge to Margaret Thatcher’s premiership. At a moment in which we are commemorating the 40th anniversary of the miners’ strikes, it is very much worth looking at this document closely.\nStamped “Secret and Personal”, the document was a memo by Robert (later Lord) Armstrong, the then cabinet secretary, sent to Thatcher in February 1985. I discovered the report while working on a Channel 4 series about the miners’ strikes, which threatened the British state as nothing had since the second world war. I always suspected MI5 had played a more interventionist role, but coming across this document was a revelation.\nArmstrong detailed a series of secret meetings in Whitehall with an unnamed MI5 officer. Their conversation did not concern foreign spies, subversion, national security or official secrets. The agenda was how to find the funds and assets of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). A lawsuit – orchestrated by David Hart, the machiavellian political adviser to Thatcher – had succeeded in declaring the dispute illegal because a national ballot had not taken place. When the NUM refused to call off the strike, the high court found the union guilty of contempt of court and issued a £200,000 fine. And when the NUM refused to pay up, a judge ordered its funds to be seized by the court-appointed sequestrator.\nIn anticipation of the court order, the NUM had transferred the union’s £8.7m through seven countries before it ended up in banks in Dublin, Zurich and Luxembourg. It was a covert and deliberately convoluted operation involving NUM officials taking private flights from Jersey to obscure banks in Luxembourg.\nAt first, the complex scheme to hide the miners’ cash was successful. The accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, in charge of the investigation, could not trace the movement of the money. And so its senior partner Brian Larkins asked the government for help.\nIn circumstances of strict secrecy, Armstrong introduced an MI5 officer to Larkins in the cabinet office. Larkins did not know his name or which agency he worked for – only that he would receive secret intelligence that would trace the miners’ funds. In exchange, Larkins agreed to provide information to MI5 that might help the agency identify any foreign backers of the NUM.\nSuddenly, Price Waterhouse was able to track down obscure NUM bank accounts and freeze the assets, sometimes without the union even realising. Bankers were mystified. How did Larkins find the secret accounts? After the strike, he was asked about his source. “It is a difficult area,” he replied.\nThe answer is contained in Armstrong’s secret memo to 10 Downing Street: MI5 leaked confidential details of NUM bank accounts and the movements of union officials to Price Waterhouse, seemingly based on covert surveillance and phone tapping.\nThe document reveals how Armstrong was nervous about MI5’s operations being disclosed. He told the prime minister that partners of Price Waterhouse were aware of his meetings with Larkins. They knew their colleague had met “an unnamed man” and information had been disclosed.\nThe “unnamed man” was, of course, an MI5 officer. He disclosed to Price Waterhouse intelligence “obtained during inquiries into sources and movements of NUM funds particularly overseas”, wrote Armstrong. “Mr Larkins was not told who the unnamed man was. But it does not take a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that he was a security service officer and that at least some of his material could have been, and probably was, obtained by interception of communications.”\nThe sensitivity about the disclosure of MI5’s involvement in bugging the phones of trade unionists, tracking their movements and tracing their bank accounts was acute in Whitehall. Armstrong was especially concerned about an attempt by Price Waterhouse to seize funds deposited by the NUM in bank accounts in Dublin. The union resisted the claim in the Irish court and the judge indicated he would ask about contacts between the British government and the sequestrator (Price Waterhouse). The problem is the sequestrator would be under oath and so their cover would be blown.\nThe cabinet secretary felt trapped and spoke to government lawyers. If his dealings with Price Waterhouse emerged in court, it might lead to disclosure of MI5’s eavesdropping of the NUM.\n“It could be argued it was a legitimate use of interception to seek to discover what assistance the NUM was receiving from overseas in the provisional movement of funds,” Armstrong wrote. “It would be more difficult to justify the use of information obtained by interception to assist the searches of the sequestrators.”\nThree days after receiving that memo, on 4 February 1985, Thatcher met the attorney general to discuss the predicament. They agreed to stand firm: no information should be given in court or in parliament about contacts between the government and the sequestrators.\nFortunately for Thatcher, the sequestrators were not required to reveal in court their dealings with the government and MI5. For years, the pretence that Price Waterhouse had uncovered the NUM accounts and banking transactions by their own sources was maintained. It was not until 1991 that the Guardian revealed how vital information used by Price Waterhouse about the NUM confidential accounts was derived from GCHQ surveillance.\nToday, 40 years after the miners’ strike, the Armstrong memo reveals how MI5 abused its power to help the government win the conflict. The document undermines the official version that the security service’s role was restricted to countering subversion and stopping an attempt to overthrow parliamentary democracy. And it should result in a reassessment of the secret state’s role in a pivotal moment in British history, the outcome of which – Thatcher’s victory over the organised working class – laid the foundations for the country we live in today.\nMark Hollingsworth is a freelance journalist and the author of books including Defending the Realm, Londongrad: From Russia with Cash and Agents of Influence: How the KGB Subverted Western Democracies."

        "headline": "Tears, fancy-dress tyranny and tedious discourse: it can only be World Book Day",
        "author": "Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett",
        "teaser": "The pressure can be overwhelming – so I gave up on green eggs and ham and found a low-effort solution",
        "published": "Thu 7 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "I was going to do green eggs and ham. That would be a cool costume, the competitive mother that sometimes lives inside me thought. Thankfully I silenced her, as I always do, not wanting to spend hours after returning from a trip to the theatre constructing said eggs and ham out of felt. My son is only two, but this year will be his second World Book Day costume. Last year I was even more half-arsed: he went to nursery as Peekaboo Moon. In other words, he wore a jumper with a moon on it.\nThe tedious online discourse about World Book Day costumes rears its head every year, but to a relatively new parent the whole thing is a bit baffling. Make a costume or don’t, buy a costume or don’t … who cares, as long as the child is happy? Except what I’m learning is that the World Book Day costume is, to some people, symbolic of what sort of parent you are, and the whole thing carries quite a lot of class baggage.\n“Of course stay-at-home mothers with literature degrees have the time to rustle up an intricate Artful Dodger costume on the sewing machine!” the mums who are low-paid nurses doing night shifts might complain. “Of course the busy working mums just bung a nylon Frozen costume in their Asda basket,” the stay-at-home mums might snipe. “It isn’t even a book!” The time-poor mums resent being expected to add to their load through crafting; the cash-poor mums find the cost of materials prohibitive. The time-poor, cash-poor mums – which seems to be most of us, in this economy – wish the whole occasion would go away. And some schools this year have listened, reasoning that the cost of living crisis means parents are being put under unreasonable pressure costume-wise. As for the dads, no one asks them, because even though it’s 2024 the whole fancy dress burden still seems to fall on women’s shoulders. (Dads who conceived and constructed their offspring’s World Book Day costumes, please get in touch via the letters desk.)\nGrowing up, World Book Day wasn’t a thing. My mother had little money but enough time to help make costumes for other occasions. She was also a skilled dressmaker, which helped. I consider our beautifully stocked fancy-dress box a great childhood privilege, but it’s unlikely my son will be as fortunate. One of the things about motherhood that has shocked me most – despite everyone trying to prepare you, it doesn’t really hit you until you’re living it – is just how difficult it is to juggle childcare even with part-time work. Managing to do anything beyond that feels like such a miraculous bonus that you end up congratulating yourself for achieving even the most rudimentary of practical tasks. Emptying the washing machine within 24 hours of a wash cycle finishing, for instance (the rinse button has had a rather gruelling and environmentally unfriendly workout these past two years). So forgive me if I don’t have time to make a pair of Victorian knickerbockers. Yet my mum also often worked part-time, and somehow always did. So now I feel bad.\nAnyway, my small boy loves Winnie-the-Pooh, and so Christopher Robin it is. We have everything required already in the house, so all I need to do is blow up a red balloon and write a note that says: “Gon out, bisy, backson, C.R.” Unfortunately, while everyone else was down a “is the Duchess of Cambridge being held prisoner having been replaced by a clone?” rabbit hole, I went down a “Christopher Robin” one, which is how I ended up crying on the sofa on Sunday morning about how AA Milne had PTSD and the real-life Christopher Robin was bullied at school for his starring role in his father’s creation. “I think you’re just crying about the idea of a child being sent to boarding school,” my husband said (I had also had one too many Manhattans the night before, though it’s true that since having a son I find the very thought of boarding school unbearably sad). He pointed out that by the end of his life Christopher Robin Milne had come to a place of acceptance regarding Winnie-the-Pooh, and had used the Disney money to set up a charity for his severely disabled daughter, Clare, which helps disabled people in the West Country to this day.\nSo consider my son’s costume a tribute, but also, as I drop him off at nursery looking adorable and clutching his Pooh bear, a sign of World Book Days to come. Whatever he’s into, I will try, within reason, to facilitate, because all that matters is that he is happy. In other words, parents, it’s not about us. Although as with many things, we seem quite gifted at making it so.\nWhat’s working\nPicard frozen organic creamed spinach. The bairn loves it, and it microwaves in minutes. It’s not cheap, but it does go a really long way and makes a really quick pasta sauce.\nWhat’s not\nWhole grapes. On recent trips to the Young V&amp;A and Tate Modern, I was perturbed to find that the fruit cups sold for children contained whole grapes – a major choking hazard, as a paediatrician in this newspaper has pointed out. I wondered if I was being OTT, but after polling other parents I felt encouraged to complain. Both museums took me seriously, with Tate Modern saying they never should have gone out uncut and Young V&amp;A taking them off sale until they could rectify the situation.\nRhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist"

        "headline": "Jeremy Hunt gave us a hit-and-run budget. But unlike cornered chancellors past, he showed no shame",
        "author": "Martin Kettle",
        "teaser": "The Tories can see the writing on the wall – so they are intent on wrecking things for an incoming Labour government",
        "published": "Wed 6 Mar 2024 19.30 CET",
        "content": "There is nothing, says the former chancellor Ken Clarke in his memoir, “so dead and forgotten as old budgets”. A chancellor’s budget is the product of months of Treasury work. It provides a spectacular pantomime on the day it is delivered. It appears to matter hugely at the time. But, as Clarke himself admits, most budgets are effectively forgotten within months.\nJeremy Hunt’s 2024 budget, delivered on Wednesday, is unlikely to be an exception. Many of its figures can be taken with a pinch of salt. They will need to be adjusted, sometimes radically, in the months ahead. Hunt’s budget will be rapidly absorbed into the existing party battle, too. It has not changed the conversation much. Nevertheless, in one very particular and politically significant way it was genuinely memorable.\nWhat Hunt produced on Wednesday was both a distinctively Conservative budget, and a recognisably pre-election budget. But it was absolutely not a credible account of the economic and fiscal problems facing Britain or of the conditions that will shape the next financial year. Instead it felt more like the work of a party that, having once believed that it was born to rule, is now reduced to being born to wreck.\nHunt’s repeated attacks on Labour – I counted at least a dozen – showed where this budget was really focused. The speech was shot through with the recognition that a Labour chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will probably be taking Hunt’s place within a few months. Hunt knows this, and so do the MPs alongside and behind him on the green benches. If and when that happens, much of what Hunt said on Wednesday will then be consigned to history. This made it the first budget speech of my lifetime whose central idea was simply to rough up the pitch as much as possible for the likely next administration.\nThe central example of this was the tax cut in employees’ national insurance contributions. This did not go far enough for the Liz Truss wing of the Conservative party, which wants income tax cuts as well. But it was designed to wrongfoot Labour, who clearly saw it coming and quickly accepted the new cuts. Even so, although Hunt unveiled some new taxes too, on vaping for example, it still takes net income out of the Treasury’s coffers that will not now be spent on public services.\nHunt went to great pains to claim he was not cutting the planned increase for next year in departmental spending. But this is a deceit. The overall tax burden, unmentioned by the chancellor at any point, will continue to rise, but the planned increase in spending for government departments is still below inflation and thus a real-terms cut. It does nothing to compensate for long years of even larger real-terms cuts. It will mean further cuts for the many departments – such as environment (climate did not rate a single mention), justice and work and pensions – whose budgets are not protected, as health and defence will be. Some of the new taxes will not come on stream next year either, let alone this year. All this is in reality being deliberately dumped on Reeves’s desk.\nThere have been pre-election budgets in British history before in which everyone knows that the chancellor’s speech was crafted with the election in mind. Several of these have been classic election giveaways and some have been rewarded with victory at the polls. But there have also been a smaller number of budgets in which neither the chancellor, nor anyone else, has any great expectation that the political tide will be turned in the election to come.\nHunt’s budget fell into this category. Yet there was one standout difference in it from the similarly fatalistic budgets of Reginald Maudling in 1964, of Denis Healey in 1979 and of Clarke in 1996, all of which were also delivered amid the expectation of an imminent change of government. Maudling and Clarke actually had decent economic stories to tell, though each could see the writing on the wall for other reasons. Healey, amid more straitened economic times and with the Callaghan government having already been defeated in a confidence vote, saw the writing too. As a result Healey explicitly avoided any tinkering or headline-grabbing measures, delivering instead what he called a “caretaker budget”.\nHunt’s budget was therefore unique among cornered chancellors. Although he claimed that the economy had turned a corner, he still had a low growth, recessionary, high-tax story to tell, not a more optimistic one. He too could see the writing on the wall (support for the Conservatives was down to 20% last month in one leading poll). But, unlike the chastened Healey who, 45 years ago, apologised to the “next chancellor” for handing over a “poisoned chalice”, Hunt showed no shame. There was no avoidance of radical changes, as there had been with Healey. Instead, Hunt delivered a hit-and-run budget.\nThis was embodied by the decision to replace non-dom tax status. When Labour proposed this very same measure two years ago, the Conservatives scoffed that it was an anti-competitive gimmick. Now the Tories have stolen their rivals’ clothes while they were bathing, as Disraeli said of his 1867 electoral reform bill. Hunt’s purpose was to make life difficult for Labour, without actually proposing a new system for non-domiciled taxpayers to put in its place.\nAlthough it is sometimes easy to take a lofty approach to budgets and to dismiss them as so much sound and fury, they do matter. They certainly matter for the Treasury, the dominant department in Whitehall and in any government, for whom budget day is not merely the supreme annual moment of its existence but also its day of maximum exposure.\nThat makes it, as Hugo Young once pointed out, into a moment for which the Treasury does not have an alibi. Wednesday’s speech should be viewed in that light, both for the Tory party and for the Treasury itself. It felt like a moment in which neither of them showed they had learned much, repeating too many of yesterday’s failed solutions to address the problems of today. The great question hanging over Britain is whether Labour has the strategic answers that the Treasury has lacked under the Tories.\nAlthough Hunt is a different kind of Conservative from Liz Truss, his tax cuts are ultimately an attempt to apply the same non-solution to today’s macroeconomic problems. They will go down well with some MPs, some Tory activists and the Tory party’s rightwing media echo chamber. But they will not necessarily cut it with the public. And they will not re-equip Britain’s broken state institutions – or make them more productive, as Hunt put it – to carry out the tasks of which only the state is capable. To carry on this way is like relying on a cavalry charge in the nuclear age.\nMartin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"

        "headline": "What’s ‘wrong’ with east Germany? Look to its long neglect by the wealthy west",
        "author": "Katja Hoyer",
        "teaser": "The far-right AfD is leading the polls in former GDR regions – and longstanding bias in German media and politics is partly to blame",
        "published": "Thu 7 Mar 2024 08.00 CET",
        "content": "The Berlin Wall “will be standing in 50 and even in 100 years”, Erich Honecker, the leader of socialist East Germany, prophesied in January 1989. Not for the first time, he was spectacularly wrong. The wall fell just 10 months later, in November 1989. But not all barriers to German unity fell with it. Honecker’s German Democratic Republic (GDR) may have been wiped off the map by subsequent events, but like an afterimage that won’t fade, its contours remain etched on Germany’s cultural, economic and political landscape.\nIn 2024, the east of the country remains in sharp focus as the heartland of anti-establishment movements. Three of the five states that once formed the GDR will hold regional elections in September, the outcomes of which are anxiously anticipated ahead of the general election set for next year. The far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is leading the polls in all three, while also being the second-strongest party nationwide. In the frantic search for answers that might help explain and combat the rise of extremism, many ask: what is wrong in the east?\nIt’s not a new question. East Germans, nicknamed Ossis, have long been viewed with suspicion by a media landscape that is overwhelmingly dominated by west Germans, or Wessis. Even the majority of regional papers in the east are run by western editorial staff, and this has consequences for the way people are seen and portrayed. Mathias Döpfner, the boss of one of Europe’s largest media groups, Axel Springer, had to apologise last year after some correspondence was leaked in which he claimed: “Ossis are either communists or fascists … disgusting.”\nHe is not the only one to feel that there is little point engaging with east Germans. During the last general election year of 2021, the government official responsible for east Germany under the then chancellor Angela Merkel (who grew up in the GDR herself) claimed that some of his fellow Ossis had been “socialised in a dictatorship in a manner so that they still haven’t arrived in democracy after 30 years”. He deemed only a small proportion “potentially retrievable”. Armin Laschet, the man who had hoped to replace Merkel as chancellor, only reluctantly travelled to the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt during his campaign, speaking mostly to invited audiences. Political wisdom was that disgruntled Ossis weren’t worth the effort, given that they only make up 16.7% of the population.\nAs east Germans are such a small and underrepresented minority, their behaviours and characteristics have lazily been written off as a deviation from the west German norm, fostering a defiant us-against-them mentality. According to a survey last year, 40% of people in the east explicitly identify as “east Germans”. Granted, that’s fewer than the 52% who feel “German”, but by contrast, only 18% of west Germans identify along the lines of their former cold war-era state.\nThis east German identity, combined with the feeling of being othered and marginalised, is a powerful thing for the AfD to exploit. The far-right party invests a lot in its presence at the grassroots level. At pub evenings, lectures and other local events, it engages with real people rather than hand-selected audiences. Messages such as “The East Rises Up!” appear on AfD placards, speaking to people who feel they have been neglected by the mainstream.\nThe way for other parties to regain the trust of east German voters therefore requires empathy, not condemnation, and that begins with acknowledging their unique experiences in the present and in the past. The complex lives east Germans had in the GDR are still often written off as “dictatorship socialisation”, as if everything they did and thought before reunification was at best irrelevant to present-day realities, at worst toxic to them. Pre-1990 biographies were seen as embarrassing, dangerous and wrong, so were self-censored by many east Germans. Even Angela Merkel, who occupied the highest political office of the land for 16 years, didn’t feel she could speak about her past freely. In a rare interview last year, she admitted she held back all this time because she feared people would say: “Now she is going on about her East Germany again.”\nThere are economic imbalances too, which many easterners don’t want to address for fear of being labelled with the widespread derogatory term “Jammerossi”, or “yammering Ossi”. Yet, the hard economic facts are undeniable. According to 2021 figures, east Germans still have 11% less disposable income than their western compatriots, and they inherit only about half as much wealth. Impose almost any economic indicator on to a map, and the old east-west divide reappears.\nBut there are signs that something is shifting in the public dialogue about the east. Last year, a new “east-west debate”, as the German media have dubbed it, began to gather pace when a number of books appeared in the bestseller lists that were written by people born in the GDR. The most successful one was The East: A West German Invention, an angry treatise on how east Germans have fared since 1990, written by the literature professor Dirk Oschmann. It argues that a combination of discrimination, underrepresentation and pre-existing power and wealth imbalances has kept the rift between east and west wide open.\nOschmann’s book sold well over 150,000 copies. He thinks the reception has been so phenomenal because “it sharply brought a blind spot of the debate about east Germany’s problems into focus, namely the great share of responsibility west Germany has for them”.\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nThere are other clear signs that the east is shifting into the national focus, even beyond the very narrow political debate around the AfD. My history of the GDR, Beyond the Wall, also fell into this new east-west debate when it appeared in translation in Germany last year. It was often discussed in connection with Oschmann’s book, and also spent months on the bestseller lists. Other new publications, including novels by and about Ossis, hit the shelves too. The books may be different in style, content, format and core audience, but what they have in common and what allowed them to touch a raw nerve is that they are all doing what Merkel felt she couldn’t just a few years ago: “going on about East Germany again”.\nA heated national discussion has been unleashed about east Germany’s past, present and future. I share Oschmann’s hope that it falls within a wider phase of renegotiation of Germany’s national self-perception. Thirty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the specific concerns, experiences and identities of east Germans still matter, and they should be taken seriously in an effort to ensure that the invisible wall in Germany won’t still be standing in 50 or even in 100 years.\nKatja Hoyer is a German-British historian and journalist.

Having already passed the Illegal Migration Act – which, as was made clear by the UNHCR, amounts to an “asylum ban” – the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill is now reaching its final stages, with the Lords voting to radically amend it on Monday and Wednesday.\nProminent peers, including those on the government’s benches, expressed deep dismay that the bill rides roughshod over the rule of law by overturning the supreme court judgment that Rwanda is not a safe country to which to send people seeking asylum. Lord Tugendhat, the Conservative peer whose nephew Tom Tugendhat is a Home Office minister, lambasted the government for behaving like the ruling party in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. The barrister and independent crossbencher Lord Anderson pointedly said the legislation “takes us for fools”.\nIn all, peers have made 10 changes to the bill, including ensuring it complies with the rule of law and that parliament cannot declare Rwanda to be safe until the treaty that governs removals to the east African country, which includes safeguards, is fully implemented. The Lords also made important amendments to ensure far greater protections for victims of modern slavery and human trafficking, and for children whose age is disputed. The bill will return to the Commons in less than two weeks – and the government will certainly reject all the Lords amendments.\nThe word in Westminster is that the only very modest concession No 10 is prepared to offer is to put in place an independent monitoring mechanism. This would replace the current arrangements for a monitoring committee that has already been appointed by the UK and Rwandan governments, and includes those supportive of the policy such as Alexander Downer, a former Australian politician who has been a vocal advocate for it.\nThis, of course, won’t buy off the Lords and there will be a period of parliamentary ping-pong with the Commons before the legislation is expected to pass by the end of the month, ahead of the Easter holiday. Labour isn’t expected to dig in at the last minute, so the government will get it on the statute book without too much difficulty. The opposition’s calculation seems to be that the policy will ultimately fail, so better to let that happen and the government to further lose the confidence of the electorate as a result.\nThe prime minister has already committed to flights taking off this spring and Home Office officials are planning for that, with the word in the department being they have been told it must be done by the end of May. No 10 is convinced that as soon as a flight takes off it will act as the deterrent to stop people making the dangerous journey across the Channel.\nBut this is engaging in a form of Orwellian doublethink – it wasn’t long ago that Rishi Sunak himself, when he was chancellor, doubted whether the plan would work, as the BBC revealed.\nIndeed, the idea that Rwanda will achieve any serious deterrent effect is an unfounded and ideological position. Instead, it will cause more human misery and there will be more deaths in the Channel. Evidence published by the Refugee Council from organisations that support people who are seeking asylum finds that the fear of being sent to Rwanda will simply result in riskier journeys to avoid detection on arrival. This includes actively avoiding the coastguard and rescue agencies and trying to reach more remote beaches. “People are saying they will not stop coming: it’s better to die trying,” explains one of the organisations working with people currently in northern France.\nThere is also a new and more permanent backlog being created as the vast majority of people eligible for removal to Rwanda under the legislation won’t be sent there. Ministers have said Rwanda can only take hundreds in the first year.\nTens of thousands will be left in limbo – and as they will be banned from applying for asylum, it won’t be possible to put them through any kind of refugee determination process. They will be left on immigration bail in the community – the use of hotels at the current extortionate daily cost will have to continue – and be expected to report periodically to the Home Office. Inevitably they will lose contact with the authorities and disappear, as there will be no incentive to stay in touch if they aren’t in the asylum process.\nIt’s easy to forget that the Rwanda plan is about these people: refugees who are the human faces behind the political and legal arguments. It is ultimately about whether we choose to give them a fair hearing on our soil and treat them with the dignity and humanity they deserve, or treat them as undeserving, inferior subhumans to be banished to an unsafe country.\nEnver Solomon is chief executive of the Refugee Council\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Jonathan Freedland",
        "teaser": "The new Rochdale MP is hardly unique. He is just highly adept at swimming in the toxic swamp that is so much of our politics",
        "published": "Fri 1 Mar 2024 19.23 CET",
        "content": "You’re going to hear a lot of talk about George Galloway in the coming days, much of it negative and almost all of it true. But there will be one charge thrown at the new member for Rochdale – winner of a byelection victory yesterday as sweeping as the triumph he recorded in Bradford West more than a decade ago – that will be false and unfair.\nStart with the accusations that stand up. Galloway poses as a man of the left – his latest vehicle is called the Workers party of Britain. But he backed Nigel Farage’s Brexit party (now Reform) in 2019 – the pair had appeared together, during the 2016 referendum campaign, laughing and smiling – and the Conservatives in Scotland in 2021. You did not misread that sentence: George Galloway voted Tory only three years ago.\nThe right are more comfortable with Galloway than you might expect. In Rochdale, he won the warm endorsement of Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National party. “George Galloway isn’t just right on keeping us out of Zionist wars,” wrote Griffin. “He also understands the position of working class white Brits on immigration.” Offered the chance to reject that support on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, Galloway’s deputy – the former MP Chris Williamson, who was suspended from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party over comments he made about antisemitism – pointedly refused. You may also have seen the photographs of Galloway apparently bonding with Steve Bannon, a one-time Trump lieutenant and current peddler of online conspiracy theories.\nOthers will remind you of Galloway’s employment history, and those facts will also be true. He did serve as a well-remunerated presenter for Press TV and Russia Today (RT), mouthpieces of Tehran and Vladimir Putin respectively – hardly a surprise given his admiration for a string of tyrannical regimes. In 1994, he stood before Saddam Hussein of Iraq, the man who had jailed, tortured and killed so many of his own people, and declared: “Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.” In 2002, he told this newspaper that “the disappearance of the Soviet Union is the biggest catastrophe of my life.” When an estimated 1,300 Syrians were killed by chemical weapons in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, Galloway did not, as most did, blame Bashar al-Assad – who he had long praised for his “dignity” – but rather pointed the finger at an imagined, if improbable, alliance of al-Qaida and … Israel. He offered no evidence, but that was his “theory”.\nIndeed, given his determination to cast himself as a defender of Muslims – a pitch that paid great dividends in Rochdale – it’s striking how often he lines up behind those who kill, maim or oppress Muslims, even in their hundreds of thousands. In 2020, Galloway used his platform on RT to dismiss the copious evidence of China’s persecution of an estimated one million Uyghur Muslims: “There are no concentration camps in China,” he said, merely “re-education centres” for terrorists that humanely seek to draw them away from the path of extremism.\nSo he should not be confused for any kind of progressive. Doubt over that question was surely set aside in 2012 when he defended Julian Assange, then facing allegations of rape, by announcing that any accusation would be rendered absurd if there had first been an act of consensual sex. As he memorably put it, “I mean, not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion.” If campaigners against sexual violence disliked that, LGBTQ+ advocates might similarly recoil from some intriguing lines that appeared in Galloway’s election literature in Rochdale. “I believe in family … I believe in men and women. God created everything in pairs.”\nHe likes to boast that he is an implacable foe of racism. Yet he was fired by Talk Radio in 2019 over a tweet the station deemed antisemitic. After Tottenham, a north London club with a strong Jewish following, lost in the Champions League final, Galloway posted: “No #Israël flags on the Cup!” (Note the diaeresis on the ë, with its whispered hint of the German umlaut, scarcely a shock from a man who’s long been fond of comparing Israel to the Nazis – a comparison that is specifically cited in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.)\nIn short, much of what you hear about Galloway from his detractors will be true. Where, then, is the falsehood? What is the unmerited charge laid against him?\nIt is the claim that he is somehow uniquely guilty of exploiting the pain of Gaza for political gain. Don’t get me wrong, he is certainly using that agony for his own advantage. He targeted the Muslim voters of Rochdale, sending them a flyer that did not mention re-opening the local maternity hospital, securing the future of the local football club or luring Primark to the town – all of which featured on the leaflet aimed at everyone else – but instead focused solely on Gaza. No, the flaw in the claim is the notion that Galloway is unique in what he’s doing.\nHe’s louder than others and his rhetoric is more florid – but the grim truth is that, when it comes to using the horror of the Israel-Hamas war, and all the fear and loathing that has stirred up in this country, Galloway is far from alone.\nThe former Conservative party deputy chair Lee Anderson was playing the same game when he baselessly accused Sadiq Khan of being so in thrall to his Islamist “mates” that he was failing to police pro-Palestinian demonstrations in London sufficiently harshly. Anderson was trying to whip up anti-Muslim sentiment, following a lead set by Suella Braverman when she spoke of “hate marches” and “mobs” – and followed again, if codedly, by Rishi Sunak in his address outside Downing Street late on Friday. He, too, attacked the marchers, warning against the threat extremism and bigotry pose to democracy – a bit rich given his indulgence of extremism and bigotry within his own party and his inability to call Anderson’s anti-Muslim prejudice by its name. Still, the prime minister can glimpse some favourable battlelines for the coming general election campaign and didn’t want to let the opportunity slip. Sunak, Braverman and Anderson all affect to have the purest motives – offering themselves as protectors of British Jews in particular, as that community faces a record surge of antisemitism – but, like Galloway, they’re in the exploitation business. Others’ pain is their gain.\nThey are the crudest practitioners, but they are not the only ones. The MPs of the Scottish National party are, of course, sincere in their outrage at the plight of Gaza. But few would argue that the ceasefire motion they tabled last week – which triggered such ructions in the Commons – was aimed solely at helping Palestinians in need. It was also designed to expose and widen the rift within the ranks of their electoral rivals, Labour. Meanwhile, Labour and the Conservatives plotted their own procedural moves thinking less of the Middle East than of the great Westminster game.\nAs it happens, this week a few members of the Commons foreign affairs committee sat in a modest room and took evidence from Israelis and Palestinians about how Britain might actually do something useful to end the bloodshed. The discussion was serious and practical – and delivered precisely zero attention or political benefit to those involved. If you want to profit from all this death and destruction, it seems the trick is not to try to solve the problem – it’s to capitalise on it, to take all that grief and heartache and trade on it.\nSo, yes, Galloway has a record that brims with poison. But he is not quite the outlier we might wish him to be. He was always a demagogue and a populist, and now our politics is crammed with such people: “Make Rochdale Great Again” was his slogan, a knowing, admiring nod to Donald Trump. As for what looks like a habit of swooping down to prey on those in pain, pitting community against community – well, maybe that once set him apart. But vultures are all around us now.\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Might we find out that convenience therapy is as bad for us as convenience food?Dr Naomi MurphyClinical and forensic psychologist\n Re your article on psychotherapy (No, it’s not all your mother’s fault! And 10 other myths about going to therapy, busted, 2 March), while a longer-term, analytic approach will not be helpful or accessible for everyone, there are many people for whom lasting psychic change can only take place in the context of a therapeutic relationship that endures for years, not months. The statement “good therapy should be time-limited” is wrong – and potentially harmful to patients who need help but have internalised the depressingly widespread idea that needing long-term help is shameful or a sign of unforgivable weakness.\nNo wonder people are turning to AI therapists and other seeming “quick fixes” rather than seeking a connection with another person who might actually understand them. What your article does inadvertently reveal is how terrified we are of our own frailty and dependency on others. Whatever “good therapy” may be, it is not something that facilitates the denial of these uncomfortable truths.Lydia PriorPsychodynamic psychotherapist\n After 24 years as a practising hypnotherapist and trainer, I am appalled that anyone should be seeing any therapist long‑term. Surely the idea of therapy is to quickly understand your behaviours, and the therapist guides you towards change. My training taught me to give the client independence. We should never have to rely on weekly long‑term sessions to cope with life. Hypnotherapy and neuro‑linguistic programming have proved that shorter sessions can make huge differences in the way people think, feel and behave.Joy Gower Great Yarmouth, Norfolk\n I read Morwenna Ferrier’s article about with interest (I saw my therapist weekly for two years. Then he let slip he’d been watching me. Had he crossed a line?, 3 March). Forty years ago, much to my astonishment, my therapist declared that he’d fallen in love with me and believed it was reciprocated. It wasn’t. He shared the same name as someone I was interested in. But that’s another story.\nI was surprised that Morwenna’s new therapist told her that James “could lose his licence”. Maybe he was medically qualified and this was what she was referring to. However, in the UK anyone can set up as a “therapist”. So it’s important to check that they are registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy or similar recognised organisations. It’s also important to know that, if you aren’t happy with your counsellor, you can change, as Morwenna did.Barbara KayWallasey, Merseyside\n Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

        "teaser": "Readers respond to Frances Ryan’s view that we should not be naive about protections promised for older and disabled people",
        "published": "Fri 8 Mar 2024 19.29 CET",
        "content": "Frances Ryan is right that the assisted dying debate is much more nuanced than it appears (I’m glad the debate on assisted dying is forging ahead. But few understand why it frightens so many, 29 February). The initial problem is that dying is a typically British muddle, stuck between outdated legal assumptions about healthcare and modern squeamishness about death. Patching yet more on to this won’t do.\nI am running out of choices in my eight-year tussle with breast cancer, and I dream of a good death. But here’s what I’m urged to deliver: a will, but I’m safely dead by then. Two powers of attorney are legal essentials too, but why two? A letter of wishes can sit alongside my will to help my executors with issues such as funeral plans, but it has limited legal status. I am not sure how preferred priorities for a care plan fits in with the welfare power of attorney or the letter of wishes. Then there’s the advance decision to refuse treatment, and perhaps this includes the do-not-resuscitate notice. I’m meant to discuss these with my family and my healthcare team.\nYou already need a lawyer to have a chance of dying nicely. If assisted dying is introduced without clear thinking and well resourced systems, we will end up with many tragedies, whatever the good intentions of those on either side of the debate. Davida HamiltonWetherby, West Yorkshire\n Frances Ryan’s point, that “it is hard to trust the state to help marginalised people to die when they fail to support them to live”, will strike a resounding chord with all families caring for someone with a disability. That a human life is precious because it is human forms the basis of our laws and justice system. Some of us have that understanding from a faith perspective, some not. It is, however, at the heart of this discussion.\nPassing the assisted dying bill in Britain may well bring a sense of peace to some who are understandably very fearful of the process of dying, and it would presumably be a good financial option for the country. However, I have learned not to trust the state to care well for marginalised people during their lives, and I certainly do not want it acting as God at the end.Clare PeckSheffield\n Frances Ryan writes that advocates of assisted dying say there will be “safeguards” in place to protect older and disabled people from abuse and coercion, but such safeguards may still permit a solution to some of the major problems faced by our society, including the provision of social care and the funding of the health service.Many older people dread “being a burden”, but if assisted dying becomes not only socially acceptable but expected (subtly, over time) then they could come to believe – without any coercion – that they ought not to be a burden and reach for an easily available solution. Lonely people, too, who feel they “might as well die” could easily be persuaded that they should. After all, old age is a terminal illness, isn’t it? Not only would they no longer be an expense to the state, but the funding that at present goes into research into such things as Alzheimer’s or chronic pain management could be diverted into some of the government’s pet projects. Surely to the benefit of all reasonable people!\nI wrote this letter in my head at 4.30 this morning when, for some reason – maybe because I myself will soon be considered old – I couldn’t sleep. But when I turned the radio on, I heard the news of Iris Apfel’s death at 102. She said that if God was kind enough to give you extra years, you should enjoy them. That attitude would certainly undermine my “modest proposal”.Cate GunnColne Engaine, Essex\n Thank you to Frances Ryan for her balanced article concerning assisted dying. There is an unrepresentative bias when celebrities such as Esther Rantzen have ready access to the media when no “celebrities” are sounded out to give an alternative viewpoint.\nFrances rightly highlights the scandal of hospice care being largely dependent on charitable giving. Surely, fully funded quality palliative care available to everyone at point of need is a better answer than the quick-fix solution of assisted death. Human beings, however close to the end of life they might be, are not pets to be put down. A good death needs to be fully articulated and made available to all.Rev Roger ChamberlainBirmingham\n Your article on the health and social care committee’s report on assisted suicide and euthanasia says: “Opinion polls have shown that between 73% and 84% of the public support legalisation within strict guidelines” (Assisted dying law may soon diverge across British Isles, MPs warn, 29 February).\nBut most people don’t realise that “assisted dying” means the swallowing of large quantities of lethal drugs, which, data from the US state of Oregon shows, have significant complication rates, with some failures. With a lethal injection (in euthanasia), you stop breathing and die of asphyxia.\nThe report rightly says that we need clear terminology and honest, open conversations around dying and death. People need mental health support when receiving a devastating diagnosis, and specialist palliative care must be available wherever they are in the country.Ilora FinlayHouse of Lords"

        "published": "Sun 10 Mar 2024 19.08 CET",
        "content": "In the weary discussion leading up to last Wednesday’s budget, much was made of the fact that the current level of taxation is at its “highest level since 1948” (Budget 2024, 6 March). I have seen no mention of the fact that the taxes then were designed to benefit the whole population through the Attlee government’s establishment of a different way of running a country.\nPoor people would, for the first time, have access to the benefits of a modern welfare state: health, social care, education and libraries, all free at the point of use, and new standards of housing at modest cost. It’s sad that our national debate now is narrowly mean-minded.\nImplicit is a view that the poor (as opposed to “hard-working families”) are out to live a life on benefits and so must be curbed and controlled, the wealthy have the right to have as much access to the dwindling welfare benefits of society as do the less well-off, and that healthcare, through the NHS, can continue to be run on a shoestring, unworthy of greater investment because, apparently, we can always turn to the private healthcare market. Surely it’s time for real change.Gillian DalleyLondon\n In your pre-budget editorial (29 February), you rather undermined the thrust of your argument regarding tax cuts for the well‑off by using the description “tax burden”. This two-word phrase is an example of how rightwing terminology has hijacked discussions about government finances.\nTax is not (or should not be considered as) a burden. It is instead a contribution to the general wellbeing and, as such, ought to be accepted by those who can easily afford it with thanks for their good fortune. Those with the highest incomes or wealth must correspondingly expect to be asked to make a suitably sufficient contribution and so relieve those less fortunate of the impact on theirs.\nI am, however, struggling to think of a word to use to replace “burden” in the formulation to better reflect this. “Tax contribution” is too neutral, “tax expectation” too much like burden. Subvention perhaps, or even subscription? Paying your subs to society does have a nice ring to it.Jack D StephenMarkinch, Fife\n It should be no surprise that a family with two children and a gross income of £74,000 is struggling (‘It’s all fallen flat’: households earning more than £60,000 on how they are struggling financially, 4 March). Treasury figures published last week show that a household consisting of two adults and two children and an income of £74,000 would be in the sixth decile. A single adult household with a gross income of £74,000 would be the top decile. Their income tax liabilities could be the same. The family of four is being taxed as if it is in the top 10%.\nThe chancellor, in his budget statement, chose to ignore this. High-earning families therefore will continue to struggle. Those with lower incomes will struggle even more. The Treasury figures show that a family on £37,500 is in the second decile but would be paying the same tax as a taxpayer without children in the seventh decile. Does the chancellor realise how out of line income tax liabilities are with taxpayers’ living standards? A way has to be found for taking account of household situations. This is what happens in many other countries.Don DraperTax and the Family\n Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I’m always telling my children how Labour has had to clear up the mess left by successive Conservative administrations. This Phillip Inman article is now displayed on the side of my freezer. Will Mr Inman now add the latest budget to the toxic legacy?Rosemary CarnellCrosskeys, Gwent\nI cannot find the words to adequately express my admiration for Beacon High School in north London ( Inside the troubled London school that stopped excluding pupils and restored calm). No other approach seems to have made such an impact; where the policies come from that cast disruptive pupils out on the streets in such numbers to get up to yet more trouble defeats reason and logic. Well done, Beacon, pupils, staff and, of course, the headteacher. Other troubled schools/academies, take note, and adapt where possible and appropriate.Jacqueline SimpsonGarforth, Leeds\nI’m with your Scottish letter writer in thinking that conversations about the weather are life affirming and quite the opposite of “burblings” (Letters). I wonder why some people seem to think “small talk” is beneath them; do they think themselves so important, their time so precious that none is spare for others?\nIn my book, to be able to say something pleasant and welcoming to anyone we meet, carefully tweaked to suit their age and appearance, indicates quick wittedness, social skills and an interest in our fellow humans. Even if someone looks away or is stony faced, a smile or shrug might be sufficient to make their day better.Susan TreagusDidsbury, Manchester\nTomiwa Owolade writes persuasively about the rewards of ritual in a simple life, but he might want to think again about describing John Updike as a “happy monk” (“Make coffee. Shower. Clean the loo. In an age of choice, rituals are the key to happiness”).\nThe great writer was serially unfaithful, seeking comfort in religious faith and sexual adventure. As Updike explained it: “If you have a secret, submerged, second life, you have somehow transcended or outwitted the confines of a single life.” That’s one way of excusing infidelity.Suzy PowlingLeiston, Suffolk\nYour article ‘Profiteering off children’: care firms in England accused of squeezing cash from councils told only half the story. It’s not just care facilities that are charging exorbitant fees, it is private special schools too. My colleagues and I wrote to 24 local authorities with freedom of information requests asking how much was spent on private special school places. All the authorities used such schools, with a spend of up to £300,000 per child per year. One large county council sent 1,765 children to these schools in 2022, at a cost to the council of £84m.\nThese costs have been rising relentlessly over the past few years. The most obvious question that arises is whether the expenditure on a private special school placement – almost 50 times the cost of a regular school placement – could not be used more imaginatively on some kind of alternative, inclusive solution to a child’s needs.Gary Thomas, Emeritus Professor in Education, University of Birmingham\nKenan Malik is quite right that “Islamophobia” is a less-than-ideal term that conflates criticism of a religion with prejudice and bigotry against Muslims, and that the latter is better called out precisely as such (“Blurring the line between criticism and bigotry fuels hatred of Muslims and Jews”, Comment).\nBut he risks falling into the same trap when he transfers the idea to “anti-Zionism” in relation to antisemitism. Zionism, an ideal born out of centuries of persecution in the Jewish diaspora, means nothing more nor less than the aspiration of the Jewish people to have self-determination in their own country. As such, it is compatible with a two-state solution that would see the same aspiration fulfilled for both Palestinians and Jews.\nOpposition to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, its treatment of Palestinians or its bombardment of Gaza should be called out as such.\nLabelling them “Zionist”, now commonly employed as a term of abuse, plays into the hands of extremists, since anti-Zionism implies not a peaceful settlement between the two peoples but the abolition of the Israeli state, an objective that would only widen and prolong the cycle of suffering.\nIt also implies that the Jewish people do not deserve the nationhood that other peoples take for granted, explaining why many Jews consider anti-Zionism (properly understood) to be antisemitic.Adrian ListerLondon N22\nVanessa Thorpe’s thoughtful piece made me wonder whether theatres need to try quite so hard (Walkouts and rows in the stalls as politics enters Theatreland stage left – or maybe right).\nEarly in 2019, with the Brexit debacle at its height, I was at several performances of Richard II at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London. When John of Gaunt declared that “England… hath made a shameful conquest of itself”, towards the end of his “scepter’d isle” speech, the reaction was palpable: gasps of recognition, wry chuckles, even stamping of feet and spontaneous applause. The audience got it every time – even 400 years later.Jane LeeKingston upon Thames, London"

May I suggest another reason why young children now have difficulty learning to read? Many appear to have little verbal interaction with the adults in their life.\nIn public I often see a parent with child in pushchair, the parent completely engaged on their mobile phone while the child, given a tablet to keep them quiet, taps and swipes distractedly as the screen changes.\nIn contrast, in a pre-digital age children in prams and pushchairs sat facing their parent as they walked along, able to engage in a lively exchange, the child cooing and gooing in conversation and in so doing developing muscularity in the speech organs.\nAged 81, I am one of a dying species: a speech teacher. Over the years, I have seen fashions in speech change from the elocution of queen’s English, through “estuary” to the more recent embrace of regional accents. One thing has remained the same: the necessity of speaking clearly and fluently in order to communicate effectively.\nIt has been my privilege and delight to volunteer in local schools since the 1970s, most recently as a trustee of a multi-academy trust; I was asked to help the reception class of a local primary school where learning to read was a major problem for some pupils, because they couldn’t form the sounds of our language. They lacked basic verbal dexterity, having little tongue and lip muscularity.\nA group was chosen to join me in the garden at lunch break, where we had great fun learning to stand up straight, fill our lungs with air and play with language sounds. In no time at all we were Humpty Dumpty’s soldiers, marching to “What a to-do to die today at a minute or two to two, A thing extremely hard to say and harder still to do,” and so on. Dubbed “the poetry group” by the other children, it became the “go to” activity, as others joined in.\nWhen children can speak, they can learn to read, so access to books becomes a joy. We all have a role to play to ensure this is so.Janice WhiteEast Bridgford, Nottinghamshire\n Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "headline": "Anderson and Braverman shout loudest, but one man has led the toxification of the Tories: Michael Gove",
        "author": "Andy Beckett",
        "teaser": "As an influential constant in government and policy formation, Gove has been key to the process of rightwing radicalisation",
        "published": "Sat 2 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "On the ever more common journey from the centre right to the far right, there are two contrasting routes conservative parties can follow. One is to welcome in demagogues such as Lee Anderson and Suella Braverman, and to borrow or indulge their extreme ideas, or only half-condemn them – thus publicising them further – in the hope that this cynical process will attract a wider range of reactionary voters. In countries widely thought of as nostalgic and disillusioned, such as contemporary Britain, it is assumed that there are a lot of these voters, however much the Tories’ terrible poll ratings suggest the contrary.\nFor a week now, the Conservatives’ contortions and divisions over Anderson’s toxic conspiracy theories have demonstrated the political risks of the demagogue approach. However, there is another way for rightwing parties to radicalise that is more subtle, less controversial and often more successful. It involves more mainstream, less abrasive conservative politicians – people generally regarded and presented by the media as reasonable – exploring and promoting hard-right ideas and turning them into policies, while insisting that nothing harsh or reckless is going on.\nTheresa May’s weaponising of English nationalism, Boris Johnson’s constant launching of culture wars and David Cameron’s drastic shrinking of the state, continued under Rishi Sunak and likely to be taken even further at next week’s budget, are all examples of Tory premiers normalising stances once largely confined to the rightwing fringes. The party has always had an aggressive edge – defending privilege requires it – but since 2010 it has dumped its more inclusive and conciliatory traditions with a speed and thoroughness quite startling for anyone who previously believed in Conservatism’s essential moderation.\nThe politician who arguably embodies this transformation more than any of the above is a Tory minister with a rare reputation for competence and civility: Michael Gove.\nUniquely, except for two interruptions of less than a year, he has been a cabinet member continuously since 2010. Education, Brexit, levelling up, housing, farming, the environment, prisons, PPE contracts, party discipline, relations between the central and devolved governments, the coordination of Whitehall: Gove has been involved in all these at a high level.\nSometimes, his influence has been decisive, as anyone who has dealings with one of England’s ever more regimented, Gove-reformed state schools will know. And sometimes his activities have been secretive and open to question. This week, he was placed under investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, shortly after this newspaper revealed that he had not registered VIP hospitality he had enjoyed at a football match with a Conservative donor, David Meller, whom a year earlier Gove had helped secure PPE contracts worth £164m.\nAs well as this ubiquity in shaping and carrying out policy, which has often been assisted by the dire quality of other Tory ministers, Gove has also helped give the governments since 2010 a particular tone: utterly tribal and sure of themselves, contemptuous of enemies, and almost always avoiding compromise in favour of doubling down. The fact that Gove has attacked his targets – such as “the blob” of lefties that supposedly controls education, and “experts” who doubt Brexit – in a voice that is calm and elaborately courteous has effectively disguised the extremity of his positions.\nYet in his writing the resemblance of some his preoccupations to those of the far right has been harder to miss. Like Johnson, Gove was a scaremongering rightwing journalist before he became a politician and has sometimes combined the two careers since. “The West faces a challenge … as profound, in its way, as the threat posed by fascism and communism,” he wrote in Celsius 7/7, a book he published the year after becoming an MP. “Islamist advance across the globe … co-opting governments, subverting states that seem ripe for overwhelming …” Except for the slightly fancy language, this could be Lee Anderson talking.\nAs a minister, Gove has often acted aggressively against what he sees as Muslim threats to “fundamental British values”. His hard-right instincts have also been apparent in his alliances. He employed Dominic Cummings as a special adviser from 2007 to 2014. Gove was the first Briton to interview President Donald Trump, and posed for a grinning, thumbs-up photo with him afterwards. Last year Gove spoke at the ultra-reactionary National Conservatism conference in London. He has a close, if volatile, political relationship with Kemi Badenoch, the confrontational business secretary, who is widely seen as the next Tory leader.\nOccasionally, he has threatened to turn into a different kind of politician. As a minister, he has removed a Conservative curb on how many books inmates can have in prison, promised to ban some pesticides, promoted more environmentally conscious agriculture and promised to outlaw no-fault evictions. Yet such initiatives, while seen by some as evidence that he is open-minded or even has a liberal side, have often been more rhetorical than real. Last year, the supposedly green Gove tried to loosen restrictions on pollution in rivers. This week, it was reported that his anti-eviction legislation, already delayed, may be “watered down” after pressure from Tory MPs who are landlords.\nIn truth, Gove’s achievements, like those of the governments he has served, have diminished since the mid-2010s. For all his energy as a minister, schemer, networker and political thinker, he is confined by the narrowing of his party’s credibility and popularity – and by the limits of hard-right Conservatism itself: a creed with diverse proponents but an electoral dependency on angry old white men, and social and economic ideas that have hardly changed since the 1980s, when he joined the party. While he likes to cite unexpected, non-Tory figures such as the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and President Franklin D Roosevelt, Gove remains strongly loyal to hierarchy, tradition and the free market.\nIf the Tories go into opposition, he will probably still be a public presence, giving fluent, upbeat interviews about the future of Conservatism to all the journalists he knows, while offstage he flits between the party machine and the rightwing thinktanks. But for many who have to live in the country that austerity and Brexit built, his brand of Toryism will probably be remembered for two things: fanaticism and misplaced confidence. To adapt a quote from his hero, Winston Churchill: never in the field of British politics was so much damage done to so many by so few.\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"

        "author": "George Monbiot",
        "teaser": "On a planet getting hotter and drier by the year, governments are wilfully ignoring a looming crisis",
        "published": "Mon 4 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "There’s a flaw in the plan. It’s not a small one: it is an Earth-sized hole in our calculations. To keep pace with the global demand for food, crop production needs to grow by at least 50% by 2050. In principle, if nothing else changes, this is feasible, thanks mostly to improvements in crop breeding and farming techniques. But everything else is going to change.\nEven if we set aside all other issues – heat impacts, soil degradation, epidemic plant diseases accelerated by the loss of genetic diversity – there is one which, without help from any other cause, could prevent the world’s people from being fed. Water.\nA paper published in 2017 estimated that to match crop production to expected demand, water use for irrigation would have to increase by 146% by the middle of this century. One minor problem. Water is already maxed out.\nIn general, the dry parts of the world are becoming drier, partly through reduced rainfall; partly through declining river flow as mountain ice and snow retreats; and partly through rising temperatures causing increased evaporation and increased transpiration by plants. Many of the world’s major growing regions are now threatened by “flash droughts”, in which hot and dry weather sucks moisture from the soil at frightening speed. Some places, such as the southwest of the US, now in its 24th year of drought, may have switched permanently to a drier state. Rivers fail to reach the sea, lakes and aquifers are shrinking, species living in freshwater are becoming extinct at roughly five times the rate of species that live on land and major cities are threatened by extreme water stress.\nAlready, agriculture accounts for 90% of the world’s freshwater use. We have pumped so much out of the ground that we’ve changed the Earth’s spin. The water required to meet growing food demand simply does not exist.\nThat 2017 paper should have sent everyone scrambling. But as usual, it was ignored by policymakers and the media. Only when the problem arrives in Europe do we acknowledge that there’s a crisis. But while there is understandable panic about the drought in Catalonia and Andalusia, there’s an almost total failure among powerful interests to acknowledge that this is just one instance of a global problem, a problem that should feature at the top of the political agenda.\nThough drought measures have triggered protests in Spain, this is far from the most dangerous flashpoint. The catchment of the Indus river is shared by three nuclear powers – India, Pakistan and China – and several highly unstable and divided regions already afflicted by hunger and extreme poverty. Today, 95% of the river’s dry season flow is extracted, mostly for irrigation. But water demand in both Pakistan and India is growing rapidly. Supply – temporarily boosted by the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush – will, before long, peak and then go into decline.\nEven under the most optimistic climate scenario, runoff from Asian glaciers is expected to peak before mid-century, and glacier mass will shrink by about 46% by 2100. Some analysts see water competition between India and Pakistan as a major cause of the repeated conflicts in Kashmir. But unless a new Indus waters treaty is struck, taking falling supplies into account, this fighting could be a mere prelude for something much worse.\nThere’s a widespread belief that these problems can be solved simply by enhancing the efficiency of irrigation: huge amounts of water are wasted in agriculture. So let me introduce you to the irrigation efficiency paradox. As better techniques ensure that less water is required to grow a given volume of crops, irrigation becomes cheaper. As a result, it attracts more investment, encourages farmers to grow thirstier, more profitable plants, and expands across a wider area. This is what happened, for instance, in the Guadiana river basin in Spain, where a €600m investment to reduce water use by improving the efficiency of irrigation has instead increased it.\nYou can overcome the paradox through regulation: laws to limit both total and individual water consumption. But governments prefer to rely on technology alone. Without political and economic measures, it doesn’t work.\nNor are other technofixes likely to solve the problem. Governments are planning massive engineering schemes to pipe water from one place to another. But climate breakdown and rising demand ensure that many of the donor regions are also likely to run dry. Water from desalination plants typically costs five or 10 times as much as water from the ground or the sky, while the process requires masses of energy and generates great volumes of toxic brine.\nAbove all, we need to change our diets. Those of us with dietary choice (in other words, the richer half of the world’s population) should seek to minimise the water footprint of our food. With apologies for harping on about it, this is yet another reason to switch to an animal-free diet, which reduces both total crop demand and, in most cases, water use. The water demand of certain plant products, especially almonds and pistachios in California, has become a major theme in the culture wars, as rightwing influencers attack plant-based diets. But, excessive as the watering of these crops is, more than twice as much irrigation water is used in California to grow forage plants to feed livestock, especially dairy cows. Dairy milk has much higher water demand even than the worst alternative (almond milk), and is astronomically higher than the best alternatives, such as oat or soya milk.\nThis is not to give all plant products a free pass: horticulture can make massive demands on water supplies. Even within a plant-based diet, we should be switching from some grains, vegetables and fruit to others. Governments and retailers should help us through a combination of stronger rules and informative labelling.\nInstead, they do the opposite. Last month, at the behest of the EU’s agricultural commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, the European Commission deleted from its new climate plan the call to incentivise “diversified” (animal-free) protein sources. Regulatory capture is never stronger than in the food and farming sector.\nI hate to pile yet more on to you, but some of us have to try to counter the endless bias against relevance in politics and most of the media. This is yet another of those massive neglected issues, any one of which could be fatal to peace and prosperity on a habitable planet. Somehow, we need to recover our focus.\nGeorge Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\nJoin George Monbiot for a Guardian Live online event on Wednesday 8 May 2024 at 8pm BST.

        "author": "Zoe Williams",
        "teaser": "We’re falling out of love with manual cars, says the DVLA. What will driving ‘enthusiasts’ have left to feel superior about now?",
        "published": "Mon 4 Mar 2024 11.00 CET",
        "content": "You can do whatever you like when you’re reviewing a car, because the cultural standard was set by Jeremy Clarkson. You’re almost expected to ding it. I once took a whole hubcap off a Toyota Hilux and pretended I’d done it off-road on a caper, when in fact I’d backed into a pillar in a car park. The Hilux was somewhat longer than I realised; watch out for that.\nThis being the case, I’d been doing the job for years without a moment’s anxiety, not even when I took a Ferrari California T on the Isle of Wight ferry and its internal alarm thought it was being car-trafficked. And then I found myself in a Fiat Spider on a winding Italian road (lovely little roadster built off the Mazda platform) and I’ve never been so stressed in my goddam life.\nThe problem was, I had a spectator. It was a press trip, we were in pairs, taking turns to drive. People who think of themselves as car enthusiasts, natural born drivers, only mean one thing: they really like changing gear, at exactly the right time. It can be rough or smooth, a box or a bang shift, it’s like jazz, it doesn’t really matter what you do so long as you make a convincing case that you did it on purpose. These drivers make noises with their mouths about handling and torque and whatnot, but all they’re really talking about is how good they are at a manual. There is no gear-changing style that’s good enough for these people, short of also being really good, which I am not. They stare at you, agape, when you’re slow or cautious changing gear, and God forbid you wait for the car display to tell you that you should be shifting; why are you even in a car if you don’t love the engagement and control?\nIt should go without saying that my driving partner at the time, a career-long car critic, was probably the best gear-changer civilisation had ever seen, but what he didn’t have was a poker face. He winced as if in physical jeopardy whenever I changed gear, which was at first too often, then later, not often enough. The quality of my driving fell rapidly to the point that, between the winding roads and my sweaty, maladroit hands, I began to feel that maybe we were both in danger, and ceded him the wheel for the rest of the day.\nSo it’s drivers like that who have my thoughts and prayers, as the DVLA announced this week that 20% of driving tests are now taken in automatics, and only 29% of registrations last year were of manual cars. I don’t personally give a stuff what other people drive, but if you have a fair wedge of your identity pinned to being good at a thing that people are no longer even bothering to learn, that’s bound to sting.\nMost people can see the sense of going automatic: it’s awesome how many driving lessons it takes to become even mediocre on the clutch. Electric and plug-in hybrids are all automatic anyway. Car future looks increasingly driverless, even if that technology is farther away than has been claimed. Car club membership might still be almost entirely (87%) a London thing, but various factors – sustainability, and the fact that no one has any money – are likely to push up demand in the medium term, and it will make sense for those fleets to go automatic if that’s what a fifth of people are learning.\nSo it’s left to What Car? magazine to worry about driving becoming a “lost art”, as it did when the DVLA figures emerged, its consumer editor, Claire Evans, commenting: “Any enthusiast will tell you that for sheer driving pleasure, manual gearboxes always win.” She’s not wrong about that. The basis of the joy is the deeper relationship with the car: you have to listen, really listen, to it, with your feet and hands as well as your ears, and in return it will be more responsive to you, the acceleration will be better, everything will feel smoother and more elegant.\nBut it’s not just about pleasure, really, it’s also about pride in one’s own excellence, and in order to truly revel in that, other people have to be bad at it. Driving manual is about to tumble from general purpose adulting – at which everyone should excel, but only some people do – to niche, nostalgic hobby, which you find out by accident someone’s great at and wonder why. I’m going to go with “not the end of the world”, but what do I know? I drove all the way to the vet in first, once, because my dog was asleep on the gear stick.\nZoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

        "published": "Tue 5 Mar 2024 08.00 CET",
        "content": "The German armed forces are mad. The leaking by Moscow of a 38-minute discussion between the head of the Luftwaffe and senior officers on sending Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine suggests that Nato’s will not to escalate the current war is weakening. The meeting, reportedly held on an unencrypted line, had all the secrecy of a teenage groupchat. It boosted Vladimir Putin’s claim that this is a war of the west against Russia, with Ukraine as mere proxy.\nThe west’s justified objective in Ukraine was to help foil Putin’s attempt to topple Kyiv’s elected government. This was achieved in a matter of months, thanks to the Ukrainian army, with western logistical support. At no point did Nato risk that timeworn precursor of so many past European wars, the reckless escalation of a local conflict into a continent-wide one.\nBut as the conflict in Ukraine has reached predictable stalemate, Nato’s strategy has lost all coherence. This is the moment when such wars run out of control. For two years now, western leaders have polished their macho images at home by visiting and goading Kyiv’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to seek total victory with their help. It was Boris Johnson’s favourite pledge, but then his voters were merely paying for it, not dying. France’s Emmanuel Macron has at least suggested sending troops.\nEqually predictable was that total victory was never on the cards. This meant that at some point doubts would ensue. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, now declares we must “stay the course”, without saying what that means. Germany’s generals may want escalation, but its chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has long been cautious. So, too, is a large swathe of US public opinion, while the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, remarks only that the west must ensure Russia’s war “continues to be a strategic failure”.\nMoscow at war can always play long. Horrific though it seemed at the time, the mooted deal in spring 2022 to revert to some version – almost any version – of the pre-February 2022 border would have made sense. Instead Ukraine has come to seem ever more like a Nato mercenary for western generals wanting to boost their budgets and relive the cold-war games of their youth. The price is paid by their taxpayers and Ukraine’s young men and women.\nWestern Europe has no conceivable interest in escalating the Ukraine war through a long-range missile exchange. While it should sustain its logistical support for Ukrainian forces, it has no strategic interest in Kyiv’s desire to drive Russia out of the majority Russian-speaking areas of Crimea or Donbas. It has every interest in assiduously seeking an early settlement and starting the rebuilding of Ukraine.\nAs for the west’s “soft power” sanctions on Russia, they have failed miserably, disrupting the global trading economy in the process. Sanctions may be beloved of western diplomats and thinktanks. They may even hurt someone – not least Britain’s energy users – but they have not devastated the Russian economy or changed Putin’s mind. This year Russia’s growth rate is expected to exceed Britain’s.\nThe crass ineptitude of a quarter of a century of western military interventions should have taught us some lessons. Apparently not.\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

        "content": "Episode two of the new season of Drive to Survive begins with an at-home scene of Father Christmas visiting Red Bull team principal Christian Horner’s house. It’s a charming vignette for the Netflix show – literally just Horner, his wife, Geri Halliwell, his two young children and a TV crew with at least two cameras so they can get both wide and cutaway shots. Those childhood opportunities to be part of father’s content farm are so precious, and Santa begins by asking the children: “Has Dad been good this year?” No, would now seem to be the answer.\nNot to break out the journalese or anything, but the boss of Formula One’s entirely dominant team is currently embroiled in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, thanks to a mushrooming scandal that I have very little legal leeway in terms of being able to discuss fully here. It’s all very Keeping Up With the Carkrashians. Let’s just say that Horner was accused of controlling behaviour by a female Red Bull employee, was cleared last week by a resolutely opaque internal probe, only for a cache of messages said to be between the two to be leaked.\nAt last weekend’s grand prix, the season opener in Bahrain, footage emerged of Horner having an intense discussion with the arguably even ghastlier father of his unbeatable driver, world champion Max Verstappen, while his Spice Girl wife private-jetted in to kiss him for the cameras with the 1000-newton jaw clench of a wronged Tory wife. F1 is heading to the next human rights abusing petrostate this weekend – Saudi Arabia – just as a whistleblower tells the governing body that its own president intervened to overturn one driver’s penalty in that very race last year.\nBefore we go on, don’t worry remotely if you don’t watch either Formula One or Drive to Survive, because they’re incredibly easily explained (obviously I never miss either). Formula One is a sport in which the chief propulsive force is provided by something other than a human, to the point that alongside the competition for the individual drivers’ trophy, it runs a team title, which it calls the “constructors’ championship”. Races happen around the world, ideally in grim autocracies, and the same guy has won pretty much all of them for quite a long time now, and will probably win all of them this season, too. Formula One has never been more boring, or more popular. Which brings us to Drive to Survive.\nDrive to Survive is a lavishly edited behind-the-scenes look at the F1 season a year prior to the one taking place at any given time, and is such a monster hit for the sport that over the past few years, up to 53% of new fans have said it was the main reason or part of the reason they began watching F1. It is the apotheosis of what we in modern sport are obliged to call “plotlines”, and if Leni Riefenstahl were still alive, I imagine she’d be shooting second unit on it. Huge numbers of those most exotic demographics – women, young people and Americans – have been drawn by Drive to Survive into becoming emotionally invested in a sport in which you can’t even see the faces of the competitors while they’re participating. Listen, I take my hat off to it.\nYou’d think one of the drivers would be the de facto star of Drive to Survive, but I have to tell you it is Horner. With the possible exception of about three 19-year-old footballers, no one in world sport has wanted to be famous quite as much as Christian Horner. He came to the realisation of this ambition comparatively late in life (he is 50), and consequently has yet to settle into his “easy charm” years. A hilariously unbearable short king, Horner is forever organising cursed clay pigeon shooting events and playing to the cameras on the pit wall, or inviting them to capture him and Geri trotting along on their horses in the Cotswolds, or being filmed asking his children leading questions about what they most wish for. “What about Max winning the world championship?” As his small daughter once put it somewhat brutally on camera: “That’s your wish.”\nThe current drama is not believed to be Horner’s wish. But it does showcase the Faustian downside of sports actively treating themselves like a soap opera. As previously happened with football, where managers have become main characters, the F1 money guys have realised that the actual sport only happens for about 90 minutes, while big bits of its aspired-to global audience are asleep. And in the case of F1, is incomprehensible unless you’re watching the on-screen clocks and stats. But the plotlines can happen the entire time, making it sensible to foreground managerial non-athletes as “characters”, and hope they create drama. The matches/races/whatevers can then just be something that happens between episodes of the soap opera.\nIn terms of those brief punctuation marks, F1 has been at a particular disadvantage because it is currently the most boring motorsport series on Earth, with its governing body either unwilling or incapable of coming up with ways of making it less so. It’s not really great for a sport if its very first fixture of the season is marked by one of Red Bull’s so-called rivals being asked if it’s effectively already over. “Unfortunately yes,” judged Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff after Verstappen’s different-galaxy 22-second rout of the rest of the field last weekend.\nConsequently, most of what people now have left to talk about is things that aren’t the sport – with the Christian Horner scandal being the absolute motherlode. Asked last year if he wished Formula One was more competitive, Horner scoffed: “there’s not one ounce of me that wishes that.” Hmm. I wonder if there is now?\nMarina Hyde is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Owen Jones",
        "teaser": "Casting your opponents as dangerous extremists is the oldest trick in the book – and this time it’s supporters of Palestine in the government’s sights ",
        "published": "Thu 7 Mar 2024 17.36 CET",
        "content": "Britain’s latest descent into authoritarianism fits a depressingly familiar pattern. This is how it tends to work: a subversive group is identified by political elites and presented as a danger to the nation, often being additionally labelled as allies or dupes of hostile foreign enemies. An air of national emergency is contrived, with exaggerated, distorted, or simply invented evidence used to justify claims of an imminent threat. The ensuing repressive measures are supposedly to defend the security of both individual citizens and the nation alike.\nThis is what was really going on when Rishi Sunak spoke of “mob rule” and warned of the “forces here at home trying to tear us apart” during his sinister prime ministerial address last Friday. It should be seen, too, as the rationale behind proposals by rightwing former Labour MP John Woodcock – appointed by the Tories as a peer, Lord Walney, and advisor on political violence after he endorsed Boris Johnson in the last election – to ban politicians from engaging with movements protesting against mass slaughter in Gaza or the climate emergency.\nThe government knows there tend to be fewer arrests at demonstrations against Israel’s onslaught than at last year’s Glastonbury music festival. This is despite an array of anti-protest laws so draconian they have been condemned by the United Nations’ human rights chief. But these manoeuvres aren’t about a genuine fear of actual threats. Rather, they are simply an expression of a basic human truth: the powerful do not like being pressured by movements with political goals they disapprove of, and will use both scaremongering and the machinery of the state to try to defeat them.\nIt is interesting that the term “McCarthyism” is now used as a pejorative label today by both left and right to describe the suppression of their own political beliefs. This confirms my feeling that very few rightwing commentators would, if pressed, openly praise the actual McCarthyism of the mid-20th century – a moral panic over the infiltration of American public life by communists. Yet they do the very same thing with the Gaza protesters of today, who face being deplatformed, demonised, targeted by law, and fired for their ceasefire demands.\nWhat is forgotten in all this is the purpose McCarthyism served. Few really believed communist infiltration was a menace to the US, but they saw an opportunity to stigmatise progressive politics and hobble trade unions, which had begun to assert themselves with unprecedented strike campaigns either side of the second world war. Much to the relief of wealthier Americans, the “red scare” worked and the political left and organised labour never recovered.\nWorkers’ movements in the UK have long suffered assaults driven by the same motives. When Woodcock today proposes protest organisers should pay the cost of policing their demonstration, he summons the ghost of Taff Vale, a legal judgment in 1901, which for a time made unions liable for the costs of taking industrial action. In Britain’s only general strike, a quarter of a century later, both Labour and the Tories warned of a revolutionary conspiracy, and its defeat led to punitive anti-union laws. In the aftermath, the former prime minister Arthur Balfour bragged: “The General Strike has taught the working class more in four days than years of talking could have done.”\nIn the 1980s, the Tories were only so keen to smash the miners because their strength was feared – they had, after all, toppled their previous government a decade earlier. While Margaret Thatcher had privately declared the miners were the “enemy within” – compared to Argentina’s junta who were the “enemy without” – she had even planned to publicly describe the Labour party as such, only taking a different tack in the wake of the 1984 Brighton bomb. Four decades after the miners’ strike began, it is notable how the defeated workers now enjoy popular sympathy, as recent documentaries underline, when they were so successfully cast as a dangerous extreme enemy.\nThe authoritarian underbelly of self-proclaimed democracies is often hidden, but it’s there nonetheless. That undercover police officers infiltrated environmental groups with fake identities for years, even having protracted relationships with female activists under false pretences, seems more reminiscent of a Stasi state than a liberal democracy. But it did happen here, and it was able to happen because such groups were cast as extreme menaces for whom democratic norms could be easily discarded.\nThere also exists a terrifying double standard in how protest is treated. Note how there was no moral panic about “mob rule” when far-right activists opportunistically hijacked the leave cause and harassed opponents outside the Houses of Parliament, with targets ranging from yours truly to former Tory MP Anna Soubry. Other extremists marched with a huge noose and gallows – claiming it was what then-prime minister Theresa May “deserved” - while self-avowed supporters of Boris Johnson alternated between chants pledging their loyalty to him and threats to hang their opponents. As Labour MP Jess Phillips aptly puts it, the difference today is that “some of the people who are upset with us at the moment have brown faces”.\nShe is quite right. Tory MPs Suella Braverman and Lee Anderson have depicted the protests – and the large Muslim presence on these marches – as evidence of the rise of Islamic extremism. This just shows how Islamophobic much of the Tory party has become, but that also fuses with a basic political fact: to the chagrin of their opponents, the protests against Israel’s onslaught represent the vast majority of public opinion, and politicians resent being pressured by a powerful movement with goals they object to. They fear, too, being scrutinised for their own complicity. Yet we’ve seen how history judges McCarthyism. What on earth will its verdict be on societies that scrutinised those who opposed the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people, rather than those complicit in such a crime?\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist"

        "author": "Frances Ryan",
        "teaser": "Keir Starmer’s party could end child poverty, ditch cruel work capability assessments – and replace the failing DWP",
        "published": "Tue 5 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "The legacy left to an incoming Labour government after 14 years of Tory rule is akin to a hated relative leaving a flooding basement and 12 parakeets in a will. It’s not an inheritance anyone would want. Few briefs exemplify this more than work and pensions. Britain’s safety net has been systematically shredded, and its public is poorer and sicker than before the Conservatives came to power. At this point, it feels as though the welfare state has been replaced with food banks.\nHere’s the good news. If the benefits system has been used to cause misery and hardship in recent years, that means it can also be utilised to bring about real good. If I were to wake up as a Labour shadow minister tomorrow, I’d pick these three priorities.\nSocial security cuts and rising prices and rents mean almost one in three children in the UK are now in poverty.\nThis kind of mass deprivation is obscene, but it’s not inevitable. I’d launch an “end child poverty” agenda, and start by scrapping the two-child benefit limit. This policy has failed miserably in its aim of getting parents into work, but has succeeded in pushing a huge number of families into severe hardship. Abolishing it would cost a relatively paltry £1.3bn a year, but would lift 250,000 children out of poverty and a further 850,000 children out of deep poverty. In other words, it’s a steal – the kind of cost effective way to make a difference most politicians dream of.\nI’d also scrap the poverty-inducing benefit cap – 92% of households affected include children – and introduce free school meals in England (the latter is already planned in Scotland and Wales). Such a package could be paid for with a modest wealth tax; equalising capital gains with income tax could alone raise about £14bn. Currently, in our unequal society, millionaires such as Rishi Sunak can pay an effective tax rate of just 23% while deprived children are so hungry they eat rubbers.\nThe work capability assessment (WCA) – famed for its cruel and inaccurate testing of disabled and chronically ill people unable to work – is one of the greatest social policy failures in modern times.\nWith record numbers of people falling out of the labour market due to ill health, and the Tories planning to scrap the WCA themselves, Labour needs to propose a humane and accurate replacement. I would create a system where evidence provided by a disabled person is trusted. A tick-box quiz done by an assessor who has met someone for an hour can’t beat their own doctor’s opinion.\nThis isn’t idealism. It is already happening in Scotland. There, adult disability payments are typically awarded on the strength of an official document (such as a prescription list or care plan) or evidence from a professional or support network, rather than by assessment. Disability Rights UK tells me it also advocates a “real world assessment” element that would consider social factors such as access to transport and whether there are suitable jobs locally that account for someone’s disability.\nIf successful, a similar system could be rolled out for the other key disability benefit, personal independence payments.\nFar from too pricey, such changes would likely save money. Currently, hundreds of millions of pounds of public money lines the pockets of private companies conducting the faulty tests. Why not spend that money on helping people?\nFrom the deaths of benefit claimants to the tens of billions wasted on the snail-pace rollout of universal credit, over the past decade the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has normalised a culture of punishment, waste and secrecy.\nReform is no longer enough. I would open a new department of social security – as Labour proposed in 2019 and as was the norm in the 1990s – with a fresh agenda and ethos. A new department could rebuild trust by working with disabled people’s organisations, stop placing ableist op-eds in the rightwing press and introduce a legal duty to safeguard “vulnerable” claimants.\nIn jobcentres, I’d scrap the use of benefit sanctions – new research shows the Tory’s “desire to look tough” means the number of benefit claimants who find a job each year has actually more than halved since 2015 – and instead provide holistic support for barriers to employment, such as mental health and childcare. Any costs would be offset in the long term by increased tax receipts and a reduced burden on public services.\nI would make tackling – not exacerbating – poverty a departmental goal. To help achieve this aim, I would reduce how much the government can deduct from people’s benefits to repay debt and help carers avoid overpayments.\nRather than a means to penalise and control, the social security system can be a dignified safety net in times of need. I’d vote for that.\nFrances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"

Her management team and promoter Live Nation said they would “vigorously” defend the suit, saying the late start arose from a technical problem during a sound check.\nCelebration is taking place following a postponement last year when Madonna suffered a serious bacterial infection and was hospitalised in June. She later said the health scare made her realise “how lucky I am to be alive”."

        "author": "Rafael Behr",
        "teaser": "The public would rather the chancellor prioritised spending on threadbare public services over tax giveaways",
        "published": "Wed 6 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "It is one of the standard nightmares. An unseen predator is bearing down on you but your legs won’t move. Terror surges up from your lungs but you can’t scream. Is that how Rishi Sunak feels about the electoral reckoning at his heels? He pulls policy levers, pushes rhetorical buttons, makes speeches, resets and relaunches, but the polls won’t budge. Defeat is breathing down his neck.\nThe rest of us are having another common nightmare. It’s the one where you urgently need to be somewhere – an exam, a job interview, a hospital appointment – but everything conspires against you. The roads are gridlocked, the time of your appointment is changed at the last minute, your train is cancelled. You need to buy a ticket but the machine is broken, the counter is shut, your wallet is empty.\nThe prime minister can’t escape his nightmare while we are living in ours. Budget day convention dictates that Westminster collectively pretends the government’s fate can be changed by a stroke of the chancellor’s pen. Conservative MPs must imagine that another tax cut, more electric than the last, will jolt the public awake and stop the nation sleepwalking towards Labour rule.\nThere are cultural trends forbidding the conclusion that it is already too late for the Tories. Labour’s paranoid fear of squandering its advantages, bolstered by a historic expertise in self-sabotage, is one. Another is media appetite for narrative twists, fed by recent memory of intense volatility. It feels safest to assume that no bet is safe.\nBalanced against those judgments are the facts of life in Britain in 2024. It is a battle to get simple things done in a degraded public realm. Almost everyone feels poorer today than they did when the Tories took power 14 years ago. It is a long time to be cycling through phases of dizzying crisis and glum stagnation.\nSpinning around without going anywhere is the most nauseating motion. People are sick of the Conservatives. It is a feeling deep in the gut that won’t be shifted with a sugar-rush tax cut, especially if it comes at the expense of public investment.\nOpinion surveys indicate stronger demand for spending on knackered services than tax giveaways, even among Tory voters. People may not be following the exact mechanics of the rule-bending, column-shuffling trick that generates the “headroom” for Jeremy Hunt to “afford” lower headline rates of taxes, but they intuit that the money has to come from somewhere. They have bumped along rutted roads that used to be smooth carriageway. They can’t see their GPs and wait all night in A&amp;E.\nThe projections of future spending that let the chancellor declare himself obedient to fiscal rules are a fiction. Forcing the curve of public borrowing relative to gross domestic product on to a downward trajectory by 2025 would involve a squeeze on budgets that would, if enacted, destroy services that are already struggling to function.\nIt might be technically possible to wring another 20% of savings out of the justice department, but not with courts and prisons worthy of a developed country. In theory, the Treasury could further reduce central government grants to local authorities, but only if it wanted to drive more of them into effective bankruptcy.\nActivating section 114(3) of the Local Government Finance Act – the emergency trigger that councils pull when they can’t make ends meet – used to be an exceptional event. It happened three times last year. A recent survey of councillors found nearly one in 10 expected to hit that threshold in the next financial year. More than half saw it coming within five years.\nHunt may believe there is money to be saved by shrinking incapacity benefits, and that claimants will then be nudged back into the labour force. The actual cost will be people with chronic health conditions sliding deeper into poverty and despair. That puts more pressure on the NHS, which is already raiding its capital budget to plug shortfalls in day-to-day spending.\nThe chancellor’s game of fantasy accounting is played by rules that allow him to balance the books by tipping the country towards social insolvency. But he knows that will be Labour’s problem soon enough.\nThis is the dirty paradox of a budget drafted in anticipation of defeat. The Tories write an oath of fiscal responsibility for the opposition to recite, which no one expects the government itself to honour. Rachel Reeves will be asked how Labour would pay for its manifesto promises if not by restoring the taxes that Hunt is cutting. The corollary question – which of today’s essential public services does Hunt intend to scrap? – goes unposed. Hunt won’t be the chancellor this time next year and Conservative-supporting media don’t care to ask him.\nThere are two electoral tactics here. First is the hope of mobilising deep-rooted public suspicion of Labour as the party of fiscal incontinence. Second is a redefinition of success for the Tories as damage limitation – salvaging enough seats to be competitive in opposition.\nWhen the general mood has turned against Sunak, his best hope is precision targeting within the narrow subset of voters who haven’t given up on him entirely. In that shallow pool, officiously monitored by Conservative MPs, swim the people who care most about tax cuts.\nThe same logic keeps Downing Street hyper-attentive to marginal voters who swung behind Boris Johnson in 2019 and are now floating towards Reform UK. That means indulging a radical rightwing caucus in parliament that treats the prime minister with open contempt. The consequent fixation on migration as a national scourge alienates people who might once have considered themselves mainstream Conservatives.\nThe fork in the road that led Sunak to a credible re-election programme on the centre ground of British politics is behind him. It would be a brave leader who, at this late stage, switched his focus away from the margins where people say they might still vote for him in order to patch things up with the masses who say they definitely won’t.\nBut the audience that most hungrily demands what Sunak and Hunt claim to be serving them will soon complain that the portion is too small. Everyone else will wonder what happened to their share.\nIf budget day goes to plan, there will be a rash of positive headlines and, in the best-case scenario, a spate of ritual speculation about a Conservative comeback. Meanwhile, the overall tax burden will still be high and public services will still be broken.\nPeople will still be afraid to get ill because they don’t think the NHS can cope with one more patient. Food banks will still be busy. Potholes won’t be filled. What will it all have been for? Not just the budget, the 16 months since the current prime minister moved into No 10 and the 149 months of Conservative rule before that. What, actually, was the point of it all? There is a question to keep Rishi Sunak up at night.\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"

In the absence of that clarification, we are killing the image from our picture service.”\nWhat are some of the problems that commentators have observed with the photograph?\nThe sleeve and the left hand of Princess Charlotte, Catherine’s eight-year-old daughter, do not align with each other. It appears part of the cuff of her jumper and part of the sleeve have been cut away, though a portion at the opening of the cuff remains, disembodied.\nIn the void that creates is Catherine’s left hand. Some have speculated about the blurring to her right hand, where her left appears to be sharp. Yet more have noticed she is wearing no wedding ring.\nThe edge of Princess Charlotte’s knee appears to be blurred, where it meets the background. Most of the background of the image is drastically out of focus, compared with the foreground, suggesting it could have been dulled – or the foreground sharpened – to make it stand out more.\nOpposite to where her sleeve appears to have been edited, Princess Charlotte’s jumper appears to blur at the bottom, and to be misaligned."

        "content": "Academy organisers promised a short and snappy ceremony – and the rest of us rolled our eyes. Don’t they do that every year? Well this time they meant it, delivering a ceremony that felt tightly scripted when needed, but enjoyably loose when there was capacity for it. The result was the most watchable Oscars in years, full of mischief and frivolity – John Cena streaking, I’m Just Ken – but never undercutting moments of real weight either. It helped that the big names turned up, by and large – where were you, Wes Anderson? You just won your first Oscar! – and most of them seemed incredibly game to boot. At last the Oscars feels like, well, the Oscars again.\nIt’s become something of a trademark for a Martin Scorsese film to enter the Oscars with a raft of nominations and then leave with no wins. The Irishman, Gangs of New York, Taxi Driver and The Wolf of Wall Street have 29 nods between them but not a single win. From most precursors it was looking like Killers of the Flower Moon would follow but a win for Lily Gladstone seemed like a sure thing, the actor becoming one of the biggest, and most visible, stars of this awards season. Her nomination in itself was historic but a win wasn’t to be with Emma Stone pulling a last-minute surprise and Gladstone, and her film, leaving with nothing. It was the only real shock in a night that mostly played it safe.\nLast year, the Baftas and the Oscars felt like they could have been from different years entirely. In London, Cate Blanchett and Austin Butler won the main acting awards; All Quiet on the Western Front swept the board. Two weeks later, in Hollywood, Michelle Yeoh, Brendan Fraser and Everything Everywhere All at Once took the honours. In 2024, the awards were in total lockstep, other than visual effects (Godzilla at the Oscars, Poor Things at the Baftas). Everyone expects the Brits to rule supreme on their own territory. But we never expected them to do so 6,000 miles from home.\nIt may only have been seven of the 23 categories in which Brits triumphed (plus Cillian Murphy, who is Irish), but something about the tone of the night made it feel yet more. And that thing was an irreverence that bordered on the shambling. Lots of winners shouted out to family, friends and co-workers in the nosebleed seats, receiving vaguely raucous yells back.\nNadia Stacey, Mark Coulier and Josh Weston accept the award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling for “Poor Things.”#Oscars#Oscars2024https://t.co/X7unxQW0XY pic.twitter.com/m6aXiolWh6\nThere was a low-key tenor to a lot of the speechery, in marked contrast with the weepier Hollywood offerings. There was modesty. There were wobbles. There was a sense of jetlag. Poor Things’ Nadia Stacey thanked “Caroline at home”. We all have a Caroline at home.\nIt used to be so simple: release your prestige drama at some point between September and December and you had a pretty solid chance of nabbing best picture. But in recent years, that prime real estate has turned distinctly sub-prime. Four of the last five best picture winners premiered long before the autumn: Oppenheimer was released in July last year, Everything Everywhere All At Once debuted at SXSW in March 2022, Coda made its bow at Sundance in January of 2021 and Parasite premiered at Cannes in May 2019. And looking ahead to next year’s Oscars, one of the expected frontrunners, Dune Part 2, has already been released – and we’re only in March. Will this prompt a release rethink from studios? And what might that mean for the fall festivals (Venice, Toronto, Telluride), who must surely be looking over their shoulders?\nIf nothing else, the Oscars this year served as a handy public service announcement that Mother’s Day in the UK is celebrated a few months earlier than in the US (fourth Sunday of Lent). Multiple British winners cheerfully shouted out the celebration, and their mums, during their speeches, including Sean Ono Lennon and The Zone of Interest’s sound designers, Johnnie Burn and Tarn Willers. Picking up her award a little later, costume designer Holly Waddington thanked “Andrew, who looks after the children so I can work”. Irony was of course that by the time most of the Oscars aired in the UK, it was the small hours of the Monday after Mother’s Day. Still – it’s the thought that counts.\n\"I'm just happy we can finally put this Barbenheimer rivalry behind us.\" Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt joke on stage at the #Oscars. https://t.co/UNgGySGz3r pic.twitter.com/QAXcIeeZ9W\n“Well, the way this award season’s turned out, it wasn’t that much of a rivalry,” Emily Blunt told Ryan Gosling onstage, the pair making what might be the last ever Barbenheimer joke we’ll hear while sneakily promoting their new film The Fall Guy. But while Oppenheimer won all the awards, it was Barbie that won everyone’s hearts (and one Oscar, for Billie Eilish). Gosling’s performance of I’m Just Ken from Barbie was always going to be a highlight but the sheer panache of the whole spectacle – an homage to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes featuring a surprise appearance from Slash for a wailing guitar solo – seemed to delight even the most jaded in the audience.\nRyan Gosling and the cast of \"Barbie\" perform \"I'm Just Ken\" at the #Oscars. https://t.co/UNgGySGz3r pic.twitter.com/00hd0Jw8cy\nJudging by the ecstatic reaction to the Arnold Schwarzenegger/Danny DeVito reunion – plus lovely deadpan villainry from Michael Keaton – the chances of a very belated sequel to much-loved 1988 comedy Twins just leapt up. Triplets had been in the works (with Eddie Murphy added to the fraternity), but the death in 2022 of director Ivan Reitman seemed to mean the project was squashed. “Jason Reitman literally stopped the project when his father died,” Schwarzenegger told the Hollywood Reporter last year. “His father wanted to do it really badly. I wanted to do it really badly. Danny DeVito wanted to do it really badly. We had the financing. When his father passed away, Jason says, ‘I never liked the idea’ and put a hold on it. I’m developing another movie with Danny; he’s so much fun to work with and so talented.” Look out for Twins 2 in a cinema near you in summer 2026.\nAfter a few too many years of showing a little too much disdain for the Oscars, complaining about the films, the ceremony and the extremely well-paid hosting gig he chose to take, Kimmel found a more agreeable tone tonight, celebrating while also prodding and, for once, making us laugh as well. His monologue was snappier than usual, his once-desperate attempts to make a viral moment were fewer than before and his show of support for below-the-line workers made for a rousing, well-timed reason to cheer. He also found time to enrage and then ridicule Donald Trump, which is of course never a bad thing.\nIt didn’t top Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty’s La La Land fiasco of 2017, but Al Pacino’s half-hearted delivery of the best picture winner was stressful enough to kill at least a few live television producers. “Best picture … uh, I have to go to the envelope for that. And I will. Here it comes. And my eyes see Oppenheimer?” the Pacino said, his questioning tone leaving everyone to figure out if he could really see Oppenheimer written in that envelope, or if he was just about to start telling a really weird anecdote. “Yes, yes!” he clarified, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.\nWe’re overdue for an Oscar category that honours an inanimate object because this year, it would be a landslide for the comically large envelope that John Cena held over his genitals on Sunday night. The wrestler turned actor had the Oscars audience – and viewers – laughing out loud (really!) when he appeared on stage seemingly stark naked, oversized muscles bulging, bashfully covering his manhood. Cena and Kimmel’s bit about Cena streaking across stage was a lovely dose of silliness that didn’t feel as contrived as some of these awards show bits can be. It was whimsical and fun in the same way it is to watch a dog walk on its hind legs.\nIt was a no good night for the streamers, with Netflix picking up just one win (for Wes Anderson’s Roald Dahl short) and Apple winning nothing at all, Killers of the Flower Moon coming away empty-handed. Combined the two companies had 32 nods going in but the night belonged to the studios, with Universal and Disney winning the big ones, and the indie upstarts, including A24 and Neon, coming up behind. A best picture win evades Netflix and looks like it might still for the near future.\nIf 90% of success is just showing up, then Bradley Cooper simply has to be in the winners portion of this list. Because no one has done more of that than Maestro’s director-star. Few nominees put in more hours in pursuit of Oscar gold than Coops – and this for a film that was considered doomed for most of awards season and that much of the internet intensely hated. He even rocked up on sitcom Abbott Elementary, which aired immediately after the Oscars, to get the last word in. Imagine what Cooper will do with a film that people actually enjoy?\nHe never had a shot at the best supporting actor statue, but a fumble by Tim Robbins when splurging out praise for the Killers of the Flower Moon star appeared to actively announce him as the victor. Robbins was abashed; DeNiro cheerful – certainly more so than after Kimmel’s crack about how when he and Jodie Foster shot Taxi Driver she was too young to be his daughter but is now too old to be his girlfriend. Still, compared to longtime compadre Al Pacino, DeNiro certainly emerges from this year’s Oscars a relative winner, even if Robbins was wrong.\nHe just couldn’t resist, could he? We were so close to having a blissfully Trump-free Oscars – no one made any laboured speeches about the end of democracy, small hands, and so forth. But then from the bowels of Truth Social came a post. “Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars” (incoherent CAPS and lack of question mark model’s own). And, due to the zippy runtime of this year’s ceremony, Kimmel had a spare minute to respond with way more brevity and punch than the former president. “Isn’t it past your jail time?” was all he needed.\nWhile one of the night’s big awards might have been taken home by someone who had only recently just won in the same category, much to her and our surprise, the ceremony was dominated by first-timers. There were Cord Jefferson and Justine Triet winning for adapted and original screenplay, three-time nominee Robert Downey Jr and Da’Vine Joy Randolph for supporting actor and actress, Cillian Murphy for actor, Christopher Nolan for director and Jonathan Glazer for international feature. The grand Oppenheimer sweep might have given the end-note a feeling of the old but it was an exciting night for the new.\nFew things make moments more memorable than a sartorial slip-up and Emma Stone’s broken frock while accepting her Oscar for best actress for her role in Poor Things is no exception. The star wore a custom strapless gown by Louis Vuitton on Sunday that seemingly got through most of the show – until Ryan Gosling’s performance of I’m Just Ken. Clearly, Gosling’s seam-busting moves had such an impact on Stone, who said she’s “pretty sure” her dress zipper broke in the midst of the song. Gosling as a peplum popper: 1. Stone accepting her award with an undamaged gown? 0.\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the night was when Godzilla Minus One won the Oscar for best visual effects, beating big-budget films Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 and Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning to show that you can make what looks like a $200m film on a $15m budget. The delighted Japanese team – Takashi Yamazaki, Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takahashi and Tatsuji Nojima – traipsed onstage in their special matching Godzilla claw shoes, before Yamazaki handed over his Godzilla toy to deliver a moving speech. “My career began 40 years ago after the shock of seeing Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. To someone so far from Hollywood, the possibility of standing on this stage seemed out of reach. And the moment we were nominated, we felt like Rocky Balboa,” he said.\nthe only Oscar news I care about is that my boy Josh Hartnett is onstage at the end of the show pic.twitter.com/oZ1IB07w2d\nWhile Josh Hartnett’s Hollywood renaissance is primarily a gift to millennials, it’s one we can all enjoy. His recent appearance in Oppenheimer brought him to the Oscars stage on Sunday, helping to accept the award for best picture, and fans rejoiced at the sight. The hope of seeing Hartnett at even more award shows in the future is a glorious victory.\nMove over Martin Scorsese: there’s a new veteran director currently killing it in front of the cameras. Steven Spielberg’s reaction shots over the course of the evening demonstrate that he, too, could wipe the floor with many of the performers in his employ. First there was the wafer-dry nod when the camera cut to him after Kimmel said: “This is what the kid from The Fabelmans looks like now.” And later some absolutely beautiful looks to camera as it apparently emerged he was the recipient of Kate McKinnon’s tasteful nudes.\nWatch out, Kimmel: John Mulaney is coming for your job and he will possibly do it better than you. Mulaney’s 90 seconds onstage were an incredible audition – using the best sound design category to launch into a perfect ramble about the 1989 Kevin Costner vehicle Field of Dreams, ending with: “I guess there’s a rule in ghost baseball, that if you leave the field at any point to become an elderly ghost and do the Heimlich manoeuvre, you can’t return to the field. I love Field of Dreams. That should win best picture! But they’ll probably go with one of this year’s.” It was silly. It was genuinely fun. It was everything they don’t usually like at the Oscars so maybe we will get Kimmel again next year.\nJonathan Glazer, a director who has made just four full-length films in the last 24 years, has never been someone visibly thirsting for an Oscar. Ben Kingsley might have sneaked a nomination for Sexy Beast and in a just world, both Nicole Kidman and Scarlett Johansson would have been in the best actress race for their roles in Birth and Under the Skin, but his films have never conformed in the way that voters prefer. Even when he chose to make a second world war film, arguably the easiest way to attract the Academy, he made one that was colder and harder than wehad ever experienced before, undeniably arresting but arguably closer to an art installation than a narrative film. Against all odds, a more artfully inclined voting body somehow approved and The Zone of Interest won both sound and international feature. It’s not something Glazer has campaigned for and clearly not something he’s driven by but it’s a long-deserved moment in the spotlight for someone who has always thrived in the dark.\nDespite reports that Messi might miss the Oscars, the dog responsible for one of the most harrowing scenes in Anatomy of a Fall did indeed appear to show – and got his own seat and everything. “Messi has an overdose scene,” Kimmel quipped in his monologue. “I haven’t seen a French actor eat vomit like that since Gérard Depardieu.”\n\"Anatomy of a Fall\" star Messi appears to pee on Matt Damon's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. https://t.co/UNgGySGz3r pic.twitter.com/yMXgsvpiip\nThe Palm Dog winner was a crowd favourite last month too, becoming enamoured with Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper and Billie Eilish at the nominees luncheon. Jury’s still out on Matt Damon though."

A cutaway camera caught Emma Stone rolling her eyes when the host poked fun at the nudity in Poor Things.\nEmma Stone's reaction to Jimmy Kimmel's joke about poor things.. oh YEAH pic.twitter.com/LlIKvGr4H2\nA poignant moment punctuated the jokes: Kimmel brought out members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Workers (IATSE), which refused to cross picket lines during the duelling actors’ and writers’ strikes of last year.\n“We were able to make deals because of the people who rallied besides us,” Kimmel said, promising that the people in the room would return the favor when IATSE came to the bargaining table.\nThe first award of the night, best supporting actress, went to a glowing Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who thanked both God and her publicist – the latter prompting Kimmel to quip that she shouldn’t have to pay a retainer for the rest of the year. Randolph’s emotional speech brought her The Holdovers co-star Paul Giamatti to tears.\nPaul Giamatti is brought to tears by Da’Vine Joy Randolph’s #Oscar win. pic.twitter.com/ZqElHZfitG\nWhen it came time for a spate of non-celebby awards such as best production design, best makeup and hairstyling, and best costume design, Kimmel called in John Cena for a bit that called back the infamous streaking incident of 1974. Wearing nothing but an awards envelope, Cena deadpanned that “costumes are so important” before announcing the winner (Holly Waddington for Poor Things).\nWe're seein' a lot of John Cena tonight! 👀#Oscars#Oscars2024https://t.co/X7unxQW0XY pic.twitter.com/X6BkkR040C\nEmily Blunt and Ryan Gosling paired up to celebrate the contributions of stunt performers throughout Hollywood history. They also took it as a chance to play up the supposed rivalry of their dueling summer blockbusters, Barbie and Oppenheimer. “I’m glad we can put this whole rivalry behind us,” Blunt said. “Even though, the way this awards season has turned out, it wasn’t actually much of a rivalry after all.”\n#Oppenheimer star Emily Blunt and #Barbie star Ryan Gosling give digs at each other about #Barbenheimer at the 2024 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/iaGqlGcfOL\nRobert Downey Jr won best supporting actor – and, perhaps, also the line of the night, when he thanked his “terrible childhood and the Academy, in that order”.\nLater, Twins co-stars Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger reunited to present best visual effects, which went to Godzilla Minus One. The editing team brought Godzilla figurines on stage – because why not? – and wore matching shoes with heels that looked like the monster’s claws.\nThe ‘GODZILLA MINUS ONE’ team are wearing Godzilla-themed shoes for today’s #Oscar red carpet. pic.twitter.com/ou4XUCAtET\nRyan Gosling’s performance of I’m Just Ken from Barbie was bound to be a crowd-pleaser, and it did not disappoint. Slash from Guns N’ Roses made an appearance, as did Barbie co-stars Margot Robbie and Simu Liu. Eagle-eyed viewers said the mis-en-scene reminded them of Marilyn Monroe’s performance of Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\nappreciate the “diamonds are a girl’s best friend” homage for the “i’m just ken” number pic.twitter.com/VJ8EVLhU1h\nGosling wore a hot-pink sequined suit, which Kimmel later tried to auction off to the crowd. Bradley Cooper’s mother, Gloria Campano, seemed interested. Though the song did not win, another one from Barbie did: What Was I Made For? by Billie Eilish.\nRyan Gosling and the cast of \"Barbie\" perform \"I'm Just Ken\" at the #Oscars. https://t.co/UNgGySGz3r pic.twitter.com/00hd0Jw8cy\nWhen it finally came down to the big four awards – best actor, actress, director and picture – Kimmel quipped that dolling out the statues “shouldn’t take too long, but it will”. Oppenheimer fans delighted in Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan’s wins, with Murphy dedicating his performance to those that he vaguely called “the peacemakers”.\n“We made a film about the man who created the atomic bomb, and for better or worse we’re all living in Oppenheimer’s world, so I’d like to dedicate this to the peacemakers everywhere,” Murphy said.\nEmma Stone won for best actress – in a broken dress – though her loviest moment of the night may have been the way she celebrated when her hair and makeup artist, Nadia Stacey, won. A video showed Stone in the Dolby lobby literally running away from a conversation to watch Stacey’s speech on a nearby television. After her speech, Kimmel read a negative review that Donald Trump left of his hosting duties on Truth Social.\nPerhaps more than the actual ceremony, social media kept its eyes peeled for backstage snaps. Whether it was a Taxi Driver reunion between Jodie Foster and Robert De Niro, Kirsten Dunst and Jessie Plemmons taking a cig break with Justine Triet (the Oscars still have a smoking section?) or Billie Eilish crashing Academy president Janet Yang’s segment, these off-the-cuff moments reminded me why we watch the Oscars. It’s not for the endless run time, overdone speeches or comedy bits, but rather than chance to see stars together in their element."

        "content": "My younger son just turned 20. We went to visit and, at his suggestion, hiked up a hill together. A birthday hike! Only a few years ago, he barely tolerated family walks, slinking off to search for a shred of 3G; I have a great photo of him and his brother in the Icelandic wilderness, surrounded by breathtaking natural wonder, heads bowed, staring at their phones. I took one this weekend of him and his dad cheerfully trekking up a Peak District path in a snowstorm while my head exploded with amazement.\nBut that’s it – no more teens. No more trails of protein powder and unwashed beakers (I’ve lost track of the one that kicked off a multi-year battle of wills, ending in me dumping it in the garden; maybe a fox took it). I’ll probably never confiscate a phone again, or discover a secret second phone and wearily confiscate that too, or empty the wastepaper basket to find it full of unnervingly good imitations of my signature. I might occasionally put my phone under my pillow with the sound up in case of a 3am emergency, but it’s no longer a habit.\nAll of that suggests my sons’ teens were a war of attrition. Actually, while we had our inglorious moments (me more than either of them), I loved it. Here’s what I learned.\nWith small children you’re almost always the solution, whatever the problem is; learning that you almost never are for teenagers is painful, but important. You can help, though: sympathy, acknowledgement, a Twix, a lift, help replacing a lost debit card or just a heartfelt, eyeroll-provoking: “I love you, you’re brilliant, it’ll be OK.”\nYou can know they sincerely and lovingly have your child’s best interests at heart and think they’re utterly wrong; learning to navigate this is really hard. I don’t know if it helped, but we took our disagreements out of the house when they happened. I remember a lot of cold, un-fun discussions on benches but I think we got a deeper understanding of how the other ticks (as well as mild hypothermia) from it.\nYour teen will tell you this frequently, but it also happens to be true: you won’t know or understand more than a fraction of what’s going on in their heads and lives, however much you fret and speculate. There’s a tricky balance to strike between respecting their privacy and showing you care and want to know how and what they’re doing; I definitely didn’t get this right.\nFor me, it was about forcing myself to have the necessary ones. Sometimes you do need to choose the battle when you’d much rather not (and actually when I did, it often turned out not to be a battle at all – a hard line can be comforting).\nUnless both you and your teenager(s) are paragons of forbearance and rationality, you’ll do and say stuff you regret. I’m still haunted by some of mine. But “sorry” is powerful: some of our best conversations came from my apologies. It’s good for them to hear you say you messed up and to get a chance to forgive you.\nGod, we watched so much TV – endless sitcoms every night. It was a no-pressure, lighthearted way to be near each other, whatever else was happening, and we needed that.\nI felt as much – maybe more – delight and wonder when my sons and their friends became adults as I did when their limbs were first unfurling, or when they learned to speak; you get the same amazing glimpses of who they are becoming (perhaps someone who voluntarily climbs mountains). Your home will fizz with possibility; it’s exciting, occasionally confronting, so funny. It’s tidier and quieter now, but I miss that, a lot.\nPeople tell you this about childbirth and hmm, my perineum begs to differ. But – and I don’t think this is just the rosy amnesiac glow of hindsight – any pain you go through in the teenage years (a time when you are, essentially, birthing new adults) is absolutely, wonderfully, worthwhile.\n Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist"

        "content": "Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer has triumphed at this year’s Oscars taking home seven awards including best picture, best actor and best director.\nThe drama, telling the story of the “father of the atomic bomb”, lost the box office battle to Barbie during last summer’s Barbenheimer showdown but has now won the awards war with Greta Gerwig’s Mattel comedy winning just one Oscar for best original song.\nCillian Murphy was named best actor for his performance, beating out Paul Giamatti and Jeffrey Wright, and Robert Downey Jr was named best supporting actor, up against Robert De Niro and Ryan Gosling.\nMurphy, winning his first Oscar from his first nomination, is also the first ever Irish-born winner in his category. “I’m a little overwhelmed,” he said before dedicating his award “to the peacemakers everywhere”.\nDowney Jr won his first Oscar after being nominated twice before for Chaplin and Tropic Thunder. “I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the Academy in that order,” he said before later adding: “I needed this job more than it needed me.”\nNolan picked up his first best director Oscar, after being nominated previously for Dunkirk, beating out Martin Scorsese and Jonathan Glazer. When speaking about cinema in his speech he said: “We don’t know where this incredible journey is going from here but to know that you think I’m a meaningful part of it means the world to me.”\nThe film also won for editing, cinematography and score.\nEmma Stone pulled a surprise, beating out favourite Lily Gladstone to be named best actress for her role in Yorgos Lanthimos’s offbeat period comedy Poor Things. It’s the actor’s second best actress Oscar after previously winning for La La Land. “It’s not about me, it’s about a team that came together to make something greater than the sum of its parts,” she said during an emotional speech.\nThe film also picked up awards for production design, hairstyling and makeup and costume design.\nJonathan Glazer’s German and Polish-language Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest was named best international feature, the first ever British film to win in this category. The film also won for sound.\nThe writer-director’s speech addressed the Israel-Palestine conflict, calling out the “dehumanisation” shown both in his film and in reality. “Right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has lead to conflict for so many innocent people,” he said, “whether the victims of October 7 in Israel or the ongoing attack in Gaza.”\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in 70s-set drama The Holdovers after winning every major precursor award on her way to the stage. “For so long, I’ve always wanted to be different and now I realise I just need to be myself,” a tearful Randolph said in her speech.\nBarbie won just one award from its eight nominations, taking home the best original song Oscar for Billie Eilish’s What Was I Made For?. Eilish, winning with brother and collaborator Finneas, received a standing ovation earlier in the evening after performing the song on stage. The pair previously won for No Time to Die.\nRyan Gosling also performed his nominated song I’m Just Ken in a diamond-studded pink suit surrounded by dancing Kens, including stars from the film, as well as a guitar cameo from Slash.\nJustine Triet and partner Arthur Harari also won best original screenplay for marital drama Anatomy of a Fall. Triet is the first French woman to win in this category. “It will help me in my midlife crisis, I think,” she joked in her speech.\nBest adapted screenplay went to Cord Jefferson for American Fiction, his first big screen script. The literary comedy is an adaptation of Percival Everett’s novel Erasure.\n20 Days in Mariupol, which tells of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, was named best documentary feature, the country’s first ever Oscar. “I wish to be able to exchange this for Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities,” war reporter turned director Mstyslav Chernov said. He added: “Cinema forms memories and memories form history.”\nIt was also a strong night for Japanese cinema with The Boy and the Heron named best animated feature and Godzilla Minus One beating out big-budget blockbusters to win best visual effects.\nWes Anderson also won his first ever Oscar for his Roald Dahl adaptation The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, which was named best live-action short. He wasn’t in attendance to accept the award.\nThe ceremony was briefly delayed with reports of security issues for attendees as a result of a pro-Palestine protest disrupting traffic with hundreds of protesters marching with signs reading “No Awards for Genocide”.\nVarious celebrities, including Billie Eilish and Ramy Youssef, also wore red pins in support of a ceasefire in Gaza. “We really want lasting justice and peace for the Palestinian people,” the Poor Things star said on the red carpet.\nHost Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the show by welcoming “these beautiful human actors” in attendance after a hard year of strikes. He called out Academy members for not nominating Greta Gerwig for best director, made a joke about Downey Jr’s troubled history, calling the night “one of his highest points”, the length of Killers of the Flower Moon and Bradley Cooper’s habit of taking his mother to awards shows.\nAfter paying tribute to the writers and actors on strike in the last year, he then brought out teamsters and below-the-line members on stage. “In your upcoming negotiations, we will stand with you,” he said. Discussions are currently underway between union IATSE and AMPTP, the alliance representing studios, with threats of a possible strike looming.\nLater in the night, Kimmel read a Truth Social post from Donald Trump attacking his role as host and asking ABC to replace him. “Isn’t it past your jail time,” he joked.\nThe ceremony brought back an old practice where a group of previous winners present acting Oscars which allowed for actors such as Lupita Nyong’o, Sam Rockwell, Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Lawrence to pay tribute to friends and co-workers.\nBefore the annual in memoriam segment, featuring stars such as Tom Wilkinson, Tina Turner, Matthew Perry and Glenda Jackson, a clip was played of the late Alexei Navalny from Oscar-winning documentary Navalny. “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing,” he said in the clip.\nOppenheimer has become the highest-grossing best picture winner since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in 2004.

        "headline": "Keeping waking in the middle of the night to pee? Here’s why – and what to do about it ",
        "teaser": "Male or female, young or old, a surprising number of us can’t make it till morning without a toilet break. Some simple changes could help",
        "content": "Every week, Hussain Al-Zubaidi, a GP, will see at least one patient who suffers from nocturia, the medical term for needing to get up in the night to pee. A weak bladder has long been known as a side-effect of getting older, and nocturia has been found to affect between 69% and 93% of men over 70. It is often related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, the swelling of the prostate and surrounding tissue that occurs with age.\n“For many men over 60, this means that their ability to empty their bladder is poorer,” says Al-Zubaidi, the lifestyle and physical activity lead for the Royal College of GPs. “They take longer when standing over the toilet and generally they’ll retain urine, which means they’re much more likely to be triggered to wake up and go for a wee in the night.”\nBut Al-Zubaidi has begun to notice a worrying new trend – many of the patients coming to see him are men or women in their 20s and 30s. Some researchers have found that nocturia can affect up to 44% of men between 20 and 40. So what is going on?\nOne theory is that this is a consequence of modern lifestyles. “I think it’s mainly down to drinking habits,” says Al-Zubaidi. “People are often busier during the day, so they tend not to ‘fluid load’ in the morning, which is what we’re designed to do. In the evenings, they’ll drink more water because they’re thirsty, and then get really awakened in the early hours when their bladder is full.”\nSuch unhealthy drinking habits may be encouraged by our fondness for streaming platforms and social media. A recent study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the US found that 32% of participants over the age of 20 had to wake up and urinate twice or more in the night. This risk was almost 50% greater in people who spent five or more hours a day watching videos in various formats.\n“I wonder whether it’s having that time for yourself in the evening while you’re watching Netflix, and suddenly you’re better able to notice your thirst, respond to it and do something about it,” says Al-Zubaidi. “But by that point, it’s a bit too late in the day and you’re going to wake up in the middle of the night needing to pee.”\nBut there are plenty of other factors that can contribute to nocturia. Rebecca Haddad, a doctor at the Hôpital Rothschild in Paris who has previously specialised in research on nocturia and ageing, says that smoking, consuming too much alcohol and being physically inactive can all reduce bladder capacity, making the need to urinate more frequent.\n“There is a link between physical activity and urine production during the day and at night,” she says.\nIn particular Haddad explains that spending too much time sitting during the day, or staring at screens in the evening, may change the body’s circadian rhythms and lead to a strange phenomenon known as nocturnal polyuria, where people pass normal amounts of urine during the day, but large volumes at night.\nLife’s big hormonal shifts also explain why nocturia becomes more common with age. Haddad points out that while it is often perceived as a male condition, it is just as much of a problem for women, with one leading study, called EpiLUTS, of 30,000 people finding that 69% of men and 76% of women over the age of 40 lived with nocturia episodes that woke them at least once in the night.\n“Nocturia is definitely about much more than just the prostate,” she says. “Menopause is one of the transitional periods that generally impacts its occurrence. Diminished levels of the hormone oestrogen may induce anatomical and physiological bladder changes, contributing to a reduction in functional bladder capacity. Excess nocturnal urine production can also be provoked by oestrogen depletion.”\nMenopause can also impair sleep and lead to weight gain, a combination of factors that drives many cases of nocturia. People with obesity and postmenopausal women are far more prone to a condition called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), where your breathing stops and starts hundreds of times during sleep, reducing the amount of oxygen that gets into the bloodstream.\n“The thinking is that when people are of increased weight, it puts strain on the heart,” says Al-Zubaidi. “And when people are also getting poor-quality sleep, the heart has to beat faster to keep your blood circulating with the oxygen that it has.”\nWhenever the heart is working harder, it releases a hormone called brain natriuretic peptide, which increases urine production. “It’s basically trying to reduce the strain on the heart by removing some of the blood volume as urine,” says Al-Zubaidi. “There’s a huge proportion of the population who have undiagnosed OSA, and nocturia is one of the nine key symptoms that could point towards that. Although many people don’t connect the two.”\nBecause of the connections between the bladder and other bodily systems, nocturia can also be a sign of chronic conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and kidney impairment.\n“Chronic kidney disease is a problem because the kidneys are no longer as effective at making concentrated urine, meaning that too much water may end up being peed,” says Prof Marcus Drake, a specialist in neurological urology at Imperial College London.\nHowever, Drake says that people should not be unduly concerned unless there is a sudden increased severity in the problem, with no apparent behavioural cause. “It is more worrying if the person is also constantly thirsty, or if there are additional unexplained symptoms such as unsteady walking or excessive snoring.”\nAt the same time, having to get up during the night to go the toilet is not ideal for your health. We’re increasingly learning that poor sleep can have all kinds of negative consequences, not just for energy levels but also for the stability of blood-sugar levels and long-term cognition.\n“When you have blood sugar that is regularly spiking, you’re more likely to retain weight, which causes obesity,” says Al-Zubaidi. “We also know that even after a single poor night’s sleep, you accumulate certain proteins in the brain that are linked to dementia in later life.”\nWhen it comes to preventing nocturia, the best advice is probably to focus on scheduling most of your fluid intake earlier in the day. In particular, Al-Zubaidi advises not having more than 330ml of fluids within three hours of going to sleep. That’s the same amount as a typical can of soft drink, or a large glassful.\n“You want to have at least a quarter of your daily fluid intake in that first hour to two hours, when your body is really requiring some hydration after sleep,” he says. “And then if you’ve been doing any exercise, try to replace that fluid there and then. We call it the golden hour – if you can do it within an hour of activity, it’s much, much better than going for a run, and then catching up three or four hours later.”\nIf you do have to get up in the night, try to get back to sleep as soon as possible. While it may be tempting to check your phone for notifications or scroll social media, the light from the screen will affect the levels of sleep hormones and make it harder to nod off again.\n“Try to avoid switching on any lights when you go for a wee,” says Al-Zubaidi. “Your eyes should be adapted to the dark, given that you’ve woken up in the middle of the night. And then try to get back into bed as soon as possible. My final tip is that one of the key signals the body uses to go to sleep is a dip in temperature. So just turn the pillow round or have the duvet off when you get back into bed, and you’re much more likely to feel sleepy again.”\n1 Overheating During sleep, your core body temperature should dip by 1-2C, a common pattern across all mammals. However, if you’re too warm – something that can be triggered either by eating a large meal close to bedtime or by consuming alcohol or caffeine in the evening, because digestion increases your metabolic rate – you might struggle to reach deep sleep. Your duvet also might be too thick.\n2 Stress A stressful day can mean that a complex network in your body known as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, which connects the brain and various glands, is still active when you’re trying to get to sleep. This means that cortisol, the main stress hormone, is far higher than your body expects it to be in the early hours of the morning. This can disrupt your natural sleep cycles.\n3 Sleep apnoea Obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition that causes you to temporarily stop breathing, is estimated to affect 1.5 million people in the UK, becoming more common in people carrying excess weight. The resulting lack of oxygen activates a survival reflex that wakes you sufficiently to start breathing again, interrupting your sleep cycle. As a result, people with the condition tend to start their mornings feeling exhausted.\n4 Heartburn Lying down for many hours in bed allows food and stomach acid to flow into the oesophagus, with this acidity slowly building throughout the night until you wake up with a burning sensation and discomfort. This can be triggered by smoking, eating large meals before bed, or consuming spicy, acidic or highly fatty foods, as well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and carbonated drinks.\n5 Restless legs syndrome This surprisingly common condition affects 5-10% of adults in the UK and can have a variety of causes, from genetic predisposition to low iron levels in the brain. Some antidepressant or antihistamine medications can exacerbate the condition. Sufferers typically experience tingling or pulling sensations in their legs, with symptoms being more intense at night. The best remedies are thought to be daily exercise, a regular sleep schedule, stretching leg muscles before bed and taking a hot bath.\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "Princess of Wales says she edited family photo recalled by picture agencies",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 15.54 CET",
        "content": "The Princess of Wales has issued a public apology and said she was responsible for digitally editing a Mother’s Day family photograph issued to the media but withdrawn by international picture agencies over suspicions it had been “manipulated”.\nThe photograph of Catherine and her three children, taken by the Prince of Wales last week and the first of the princess since she underwent abdominal surgery in January, caused widespread speculation on social media, with the incident used to raise questions over public trust in the royal family.\nReleased at a time when conspiracy theories over her illness and absence flooded social media, it sought to reassure the public of her recovery but backfired spectacularly, fuelling claims it could be faked.\nWith the debacle threatening to overshadow the king’s Commonwealth Day message, the princess released a brief statement on social media, which said: “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day. C.”\nFive international picture agencies that initially distributed the image sent to them by Kensington Palace took the rare – if not unprecedented – step of issuing so-called “kill” notices to withdraw it after concerns over manipulation, in particular with regard to Princess Charlotte’s cardigan sleeve. The UK-based PA Media later also withdrew it, after seeking and failing to get “urgent clarification” from the palace.\nA royal source later said Catherine had made “minor adjustments” to the image. “This was an amateur, family photograph taken by the Prince of Wales. Their Royal Highnesses wanted to offer an informal picture of the family together for Mother’s Day.\n“The princess made minor adjustments as she shared in her statement on social media, the Wales family spent Mother’s Day together and had a wonderful day,” the source said.\nDespite calls for the original to be published, Kensington Palace said it would not be reissuing the unedited photograph.\nClaims of digital manipulation led to a feeding frenzy on social media, with comments calling into question the positioning of Catherine’s zip and the fact she was missing her wedding rings, the positioning of Prince Louis’ fingers, even the leaves of the background trees being too green for early March.\nThe debacle has led to the palace facing controversy over the issue of trust, and raised questions over whether – or to what extent – the images have been altered in the past.\nSky News said an examination of the photo’s meta data revealed it was saved in Adobe Photoshop twice on an Apple Mac on Friday and Saturday and that the picture was taken on a Canon camera.\nThe row erupted before William and the Queen Camilla were due to join the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey in the absence of the king, who is continuing treatment for cancer.\nKensington Palace later confirmed that Catherine left Windsor in a car with Prince William, who was driven to the Commonwealth Day service in London. She is not attending the service, but is understood to have a private appointment.\nMark Borkowski, a public relations consultant, called the photograph fiasco a “massive own goal” and said the unedited photograph should be released to regain trust.\nThe independent factchecking website Full Fact said it exemplified how greater transparency was crucial in preserving trust in images online. “In today’s information environment, any manipulation of an image, even relatively minor edits done with no intention to mislead, can raise suspicions,” said its chief executive, Chris Morris. “The rapid spread of image manipulation tools has changed the rules of the game. Conspiracy theories thrive in information vacuums, so if you want to be trusted, you have to be transparent.”\nGraham Smith, of the campaign group Republic, said: “This kind of dystopian behaviour you might expect from Soviet Russia, not modern Britain. The monarchy has always sought to manipulate and manage its image, but if they have tried to fake a photograph to silence online conspiracy theories. That is disgraceful.”\nThe royal author Omid Scobie, seen as a cheerleader for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, wrote on X that if it was an isolated incident, it was an “unfortunate error”.\nHe added: “But with the palace’s long history of lying, covering up, and even issuing statements on behalf of family members without their permission (cc: Prince Harry), it’s becoming increasingly difficult for the public to believe a word (and now photo) they share.\n“Gaining that back at this point is an almost impossible task.”\nCatherine underwent surgery at the London Clinic on 16 January, but details of her condition have been kept private, and she is not expected to return to official duties until after Easter."

        "headline": "Mitch McConnell loathes Trump more than most, but he’s been his top enabler",
        "author": "Sidney Blumenthal",
        "teaser": "Their unholy alliance cannot be mistaken for a Faustian bargain; neither had much soul left to sell",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 11.09 CET",
        "content": "The convergence on 28 February of Mitch McConnell’s retirement announcement as the Republican Senate leader with the supreme court’s order to accept Donald Trump’s appeal to consider his immunity from prosecution was a bitter irony for McConnell and triumph for Trump. It is a telltale subplot in Trump’s theater of humiliation in which the supreme court is playing a starring role as his best supporting actor.\nOn 4 March came another supreme court-delivered victory for Trump. “A big win for America,” tweeted Trump. In a spray of divided opinion the court’s overturning of the state of Colorado’s ruling that Trump was disqualified from the ballot for being an insurrectionist under the 14th amendment section 3 enhanced his impunity and encouraged his grasp for absolute power.\nMcConnell, the partisan architect of the partisan supreme court majority, could, if he wished to boast, rightly claim credit for those justices staging the timely rescue of his nemesis. Putting in place justice after justice, breaking precedent after precedent, he is the father of this court’s majority. He considers it his greatest accomplishment.\nMcConnell’s cold arrangement with Trump was strictly business: McConnell protected Trump in exchange for Trump packing the court. While few truly deeply loathe Trump more than McConnell, nobody has been a more consequential enabler or fatally miscalculated the spread of his stain. But their unholy alliance cannot be mistaken for a Faustian bargain; neither was selling his soul.\nMcConnell made plain the purely transactional basis of the relationship when he endorsed Trump after Super Tuesday, citing how “we worked together to accomplish great things for the American people … a generational change of our federal judiciary – most importantly, the supreme court”.\nIn the Trump disqualification case, a conservative majority of five on the supreme court effectively engaged in a nullification of the 14th amendment. The court ignored or warped the history of the 14th amendment, which was conceived and enacted to prevent insurrectionists from holding federal offices. To defend Trump, the conservative majority threw overboard originalism and textualism, the alpha and omega of its contrived legal ideology, as an obstacle to the desired result. Through a bizarre concatenation of historical falsehoods and legal contrivances, they refused to define whether Trump is an insurrectionist, or mention the word, which is the essence of the relevant section 3.\nInstead they went to an extreme edge to justify maintaining Trump’s place on the ballot, inventing a remedy that will never be applied, that only congressional legislation can determine disqualification of a person for federal office. In short, they granted Trump immunity from disqualification for attempting to overthrow the government of the United States.\nUnanimity was a thin illusion of consensus. Justice Amy Coney Barrett uncomfortably filed her own opinion to dissent from the other conservatives’ overreaching. The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, in their separate concurrence, systematically knocked down every specious claim in the majority opinion – the false precedents cited, the false notion that disqualification is not self-executing, the bowdlerized quotes to achieve a false conclusion – yet signed on to avoid “a chaotic state-by-state patchwork, at odds with our Nation’s federalism principles”, though that supposition is both narrow and vague.\nThen they flayed the majority for straying from the “fundamental principle of judicial restraint [that] is practically as old as our Republic”.\nThey stated that by resolving “many unsettled questions about Section 3 the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President”. But their opinion did not stop there. They charged that “the majority attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office”. The category of “all alleged insurrectionists” encompasses the Republican members of the Congress who were involved in Trump’s coup attempt. The reference to “future challenges” applies first and foremost to Donald Trump. The liberal concurrence is a fierce dissent from the majority’s manufacture of an insurrectionist protection act. The decision has exposed a splintered court and left to the immunity case the outstanding issue of “an oathbreaking insurrectionist … becoming President”.\nIn the immunity case the court has declined to let it go forward after a three federal judge panel ruled on all the questions at its heart and special counsel Jack Smith urged deliberate speed. Instead, the court scheduled to hold a hearing during the week of 22 April, in the full knowledge that every delay makes Trump’s escape from justice more possible and that postponement serves Trump’s strategy.\nThe immunity case will not reach trial, if there is one, until months after the court’s eventual ruling on whether a president is an absolute dictator. Given the calendar, it appears highly unlikely the trial will be concluded by election day. The court’s charade of taking on the decision as a matter of prudence is a transparent stalling tactic to deny the voters the test of the evidence in a court of law so they could make a fully informed decision of their own. Slow-walking the January 6 prosecution of Trump, the court has granted him de facto immunity for the course of the campaign. Tick, tock.\nWith its aid and comfort to Trump in both the disqualification and immunity cases, the Roberts court (or, if one prefers, the Thomas court) has shown itself to be the most politically driven since the Taney court that decided the Dred Scott case (or, if one prefers, the Rehnquist/Scalia court that brutally decided Bush v Gore).\nOn the disqualification case, Trump skates scot-free. On the immunity case, the court kicks the can as far into the future as it benefits him. For these gifts from this court, Trump owes a debt of ultimate gratitude to Mitch McConnell.\nMcConnell had many reasons for declaring he has reached the twilight of his career, even though the Republicans may gain control of the Senate after the election and he would be leader again. His health, after all, is fragile. He froze speechless twice in press conferences. He has suffered a terrible personal tragedy, the accidental drowning of his wife’s sister. But approaching the promised land once more, which might be his culmination, he restrained himself from entering. He announced he would relinquish the enormous power he has accumulated over a lifetime because he could see it ebbing away to his worst enemy. That very worst enemy is not Joe Biden, who he likes and would destroy out of cold partisanship, but Trump, who he hates with a white-hot passion, but whom he has safeguarded and would help become “dictator for a day”.\n“Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular time,” said McConnell in his Senate speech announcing his retirement. “I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not one of them.” Believe him, he can count.\nOn 13 February, two weeks earlier, he helped engineer Senate passage of a compromise bill wrapping a package of policies on the border and immigration with funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. He was particularly intent on providing aid to beleaguered Ukraine, where he has traveled to express his support directly to President Zelensky. The bill passed with 71 votes, clearing the hurdle of an obstructionist filibuster, McConnell’s blunt instrument of choice. Yet he could muster only 22 Republican votes. It was his Pyrrhic victory. He lost a majority of his conference, nearly all those elected since 2018 and under 55 years old. His iron grip faltered from Trump’s pressure.\nMcConnell’s bleak persona had no popular appeal. His influence has always been achieved through cash. As party boss, like party bosses of the past, he rewarded regularity from his members. He was shocked to discover the cult of personality that altered the base of the party. “Things are changing just not fast enough,” tweeted Senator Eric Schmitt, a Trump zealot explaining his and others’ vote against the omnibus bill as a vote of no confidence in McConnell’s leadership. He had always assumed that dark money talks and senators walk. But he now encountered a greater motivating fear.\nMcConnell’s enforcement of the party line made him appear like Senate leaders before him. His acolytes praise him as an “institutionalist”. He basks in presenting himself as a “constitutionalist”. But to build his power McConnell has subverted constitutional norms and standards, corroded and corrupted checks and balances, and drastically weakened the Senate through his explosive abuse of filibusters to transfer power to the federal courts, which he stuffed with Federalist Society cadres. He has been more than a great anti-institutionalist; he has been an anti-constitutionalist.\nMcConnell’s great crusade was to tear down the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (the so-called McCain-Feingold bill) and open the sluice gates for dark money. The year after its passage he filed his opposition in a case that made its way to the supreme court, McConnell v Federal Election Commission, which he lost in a 5-4 ruling upholding the bill. Still, he persisted.\nIn 2006, far-right Samuel Alito was nominated to replace Sandra Day O’Connor on the court. She was a moderate Republican of the old school, who upheld abortion rights and campaign finance reform. When 25 Democrats attempted a symbolic filibuster against Alito, McConnell took the floor to denounce the effort as unconstitutional: “Mr President, we stand today on the brink of a new and reckless effort by a few to deny the rights of many to exercise our constitutional duty to advise and consent, to give this man the simple up or down vote he deserves. The Senate should repudiate this tactic.”\nIn 2010, with Alito on the court, it ruled 5-4 in Citizens United v FEC that restrictions on independent campaign funds – dark money – were violated free speech. “So, all Citizens United did was to level the playing field for corporate speech,” said McConnell. It was his emancipation proclamation; he freed the dark money.\nIn 2014, McConnell filed an amicus brief in McCutcheon, et al v FEC, a case he inspired that was backed by the Republican National Committee, challenging aggregate limits on campaign contributions as “a severe infringement on the rights of speech.” The supreme court ruled for McCutcheon in a 5-4 decision.\nWith the election of Barack Obama to the presidency, McConnell laid down the Republican line. “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,” he ordered. His tactic was the filibuster that he had decried. During the Obama presidency, McConnell held up 517 Senate debates through filibusters. The Senate Republicans successfully filibustered 79 Obama federal judicial nominees during his first five years, compared to 68 in entire previous history. After the Republicans gained control of the Senate in 2015, they blocked 50 of 70 nominations to federal judgeships.\nThrough dark money and filibusters, servicing corporate interests, McConnell built a new political machine at the expense of paralyzing and diminishing the Senate. He capped his obstructions after the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. If Obama were to succeed in seating his appointment on the supreme court the majority would tilt 5-4 against the conservatives.\nMcConnell refused to allow even a single committee hearing for Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, a highly regarded judge of the most moderate temperament on the DC district court. McConnell asserted a novel doctrine that a nomination to the supreme court could not be considered in a president’s last year and that the vacancy must be filled by the next president. He dubbed his gambit “a constitutional right”. “One of my proudest moments,” he said after killing the Garland nomination, “was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, ‘Mr President, you will not fill the supreme court vacancy.’” When Sean Hannity later asked McConnell wondered why Obama left so many vacancies on the federal courts, McConnell replied: “I’ll tell you why. I was in charge of what we did the last two years of the Obama administration.”\nIn the 2016 campaign, McConnell backed Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, an acolyte, in the primaries. After Trump bulldozed his way to the nomination, McConnell expected him to be a dead weight on Republican Senate candidates. He suggested that they could separate themselves by running negatives ads against him. “We’ll drop him like a hot rock,” he said.\nMcConnell remained complacent that he was the enduring Republican standard and Trump the blip. “My view is that Trump will not change the Republican party,” he said. “If he brings in new followers, that’s great, and well worth the effort, but he will not change the Republican party … I think he’d be fine.” He added as an additional note of reassurance that the constitution “constrains all of us, members of Congress and the president as well”.\nWatching Trump’s win on election night, McConnell said: “The first thing that came to my mind was the supreme court.” He was soon in touch with Leonard Leo, chairman of the Federalist Society, who described McConnell as his “vigilant and irrepressible” partner in gaining control of the federal courts. Leo was an octopus of dark money operations, his tentacles reaching far and wide. After Citizens United, he sat atop hundreds of millions and then billions of dollars to promote his causes and McConnell’s candidates.\nA week after the election, Leo carried a list of court nominees into a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower. Trump’s first supreme court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was on the list. His second and third nominees, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, were on Leo’s next list. Leo sent more lists to the White House, rubber-stamped by White House counsel Don McGahn, a Federalist Society stalwart, and McConnell would process them through the Senate. Eighty-five per cent of Trump’s court appointees were Federalist Society members. He was entrenching conservative power in the courts for a generation to come. Trump remarked privately, “Mitch McConnell. Judges. Judges. Judges. The only thing he wants is judges.” McConnell told Trump: “MrPresident, when are you going to thank me for that?”\nSix weeks before election day, on 18 September 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. As soon as McConnell heard the news he called Trump: “First, I’m going to put out a statement that says we’re going to fill the vacancy. Second, you’ve got to nominate Amy Coney Barrett.” McConnell’s doctrine that a president could not fill a supreme court vacancy in an election year suddenly evaporated. “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” Barrett was sworn in on 26 October. McConnell’s relationship with Trump got him what he wanted. The conservative majority on the court was now seven to three.\nThen, on January 6, McConnell hid in a corner of the Capitol, fearing for his life and quaking with rage. He recovered his equanimity within hours when he thought the event would destroy Trump. “I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow finally, totally discredited himself,” McConnell told Jonathan Martin, then a reporter at the New York Times. “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Couldn’t have happened at a better time.” Trump was a “despicable person” whose influence he would finally end by defeating his candidates in the 2022 midterms. “We crushed the sons of bitches,” he told Martin, “and that’s what we’re going to do in the primary in 22.”\nMcConnell had shielded Trump from removal in the Senate during his first impeachment for seeking to blackmail the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in exchange for fabricated political dirt on Joe Biden. In Trump’s second impeachment for the insurrection, McConnell protected him again. In his floor speech explaining why he voted against Trump’s removal, he made the case that Trump’s actions properly belonged to the criminal justice system: “President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn’t get away with anything yet – yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”\nAfter Trump left office, he blamed McConnell from not protecting him enough. “The old crow is a piece of shit,” he told Maggie Haberman of the New York Times. He was especially angry that McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, who had been Trump’s secretary of transportation, quit in protest after January 6. In 2022, Trump tweeted a thinly disguised death threat against McConnell and a racist slur against Chao. “He has a DEATH WISH. Must immediately seek help and advise [sic] from his China loving wife, Coco Chow!”\nThe conservative Wall Street Journal editorialized: “Mr. Trump’s apologists claim he merely meant Mr McConnell has a political death wish, but that isn’t what he wrote. It’s all too easy to imagine some fanatic taking Mr Trump seriously and literally, and attempting to kill Mr McConnell. Many supporters took Mr Trump’s rhetoric about former Vice-President Mike Pence all too seriously on Jan 6.”\nMcConnell has a decades-long history in the Senate from intern to dinosaur, from minion to overlord, but his overweening pride in his shrewdness, his inner hackery, has prevented him from learning any larger lessons of history that explain his fall. He cannot dispense with his ingrained belief that he remains the true Republican and that there is an invisible Republican party that belongs to him, not Trump.\nLike so many presumptive adults in the room, he has operated on the logic of Franz von Papen, the former German chancellor, who convinced President Paul von Hindenburg in January 1933 to appoint Hitler chancellor, with himself as vice-chancellor, on the assumption that he would control him. “We’ve hired him,” said Von Papen. After the Night of the Long Knives, the Junker aristocrat was shipped off to Vienna as ambassador. Not that Trump is Hitler, of course, just that the book of Hitler’s table conversation is the only book Trump is known to have kept on his nightstand.\nEven as McConnell announced his retirement, his aides were negotiating his endorsement of Trump. McConnell could justify the hypocrisy of supporting a figure he considers an enemy of constitutional government as a last act of selfless sacrifice to help elect a Republican majority in the Senate. It would be his final performance as Trump’s enabler for which, like everyone else who enables Trump, he would inevitably receive ashes. In their mutual contempt, the psychopath has the advantage over the cynic.\nSidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth"

Thanks, Bumble.\n“Just one more profile and I’ll quit,” I tell myself. Yeah, right, who am I kidding?\nI’m in a mad swiping frenzy, bug-eyed and blurry, eyes wide shut.\nI rounded marathon mode a few hours ago and I’m deep in the flow state, swiping through midlife profiles like an Olympic skier hitting the slalom gates – right, left, right, left.\n“Keep the pace, Shanti, you got this,” I say, trying to stay positive while blindly coaching myself through the ominous obstacle course of finding love online.\nMy adrenaline is pumping and I’m barreling through profiles at warp speed when bam, I’m hit by a wall of hard-nos – an avalanche of bad eggs coming at me in rapid-fire succession.\n“Oh God, no!” Next.\n“Absolutely not!” Yikes.\n“What on earth?” Eek.\n“‘BunInUrOven69,’ not you again!” Once was more than enough.\nAm I hallucinating or is Bumble sending me profiles I rejected five hours ago?\nAs if I changed my mind about scaling Half Dome with the ethical non-monogamist (and his wife), or grabbing a green juice with the polyamorous Peter Pan from Never Never Land. Believe me, I haven’t.\nAnd call me old-fashioned (or just plain lazy) but I just can’t wrap my head around midlife polyamory. For starters, who has that kind of time?\n“DramaFreeDudeDad,” really? You’re 63, with a freakin’ toddler, four dogs, and a sailboat. Do you really have the energy for multiple partners – or the sexual chutzpah, for that matter? If so, “I’ll have what he’s having.”\nAll the power to them, but isn’t there a separate app for “multitasking,” or a galaxy far, far away, somewhere between Burning Man and Bikram Yoga?\nIt would make my online dating life a hell of a lot easier, that’s for sure. I wouldn’t have to decipher the small (but very crucial) print, and considering I mistook ENM (ethical non-monogamy) for an affinity for electronic dance music (EDM), I could use all the help I can get. Good grief.\nNow I have to learn a bunch of dating acronyms that essentially all mean the same thing. “CNM” (consensual non-monogamy), “GGG” (good, giving, and game), “SWT” (sex without troubles) – I get it, you don’t want to commit, just spell it out! I’m already up to my midlife-ears in business acronyms and corporate psychobabble. Are there no more sacred spaces?\nDespite having only exerted my right thumb for the last seven hours, I’m getting hangry.\n“For the love of God, not another blurry bathroom selfie!” I groan. “You’re telling me you’re a 59-year-old ‘Engineer at Tech’ with a degree from Stanford and you can’t figure out how to use an iPhone?” Give me a break. “It’s called a ‘timer’ and you don’t need a PhD to figure it out. Nobody wants to see your messy vanity!” Next.\nHaving just sent two dozen profiles down the bad egg chute (more like the rotten egg chute), I’m growing increasingly disillusioned, desperately swiping through heaps of rubbish looking for something edible. Uh oh. Is this Bumble purgatory?\nWhat happened?\nSeven hours ago, I was hopeful, excited, confident (and sober). I was riding an epic wave and feeling pretty good about my plan to go back online to find a partner, in earnest this time. “No more mucking around,” I told myself. “It’s time to put on your big girl soft pants” – I was already wearing them, the soft part anyway – “swap out the rose-colored glasses for progressives” – I’ve been resisting them with all my Gen-X heart – “and get down to business.”\nLess talk and more texting, no more hiding behind the digital curtain. I’d be more discerning, more decisive, and more honest with myself about I want in a partner – less “Oh, he’s cute, maybe I’ll learn to love skydiving and jam bands,” and more “I’m 54, there’s no way in hell I’m leaping out of an airplane or listening to the Grateful Dead, no matter what he looks like. Next.”\nAnd most importantly, no more lying about my age.\nIt was time to embrace midlife, menopause and online dating in all its glory. Full throttle.\nWell, that was the plan anyway. In a moment of weakness, I knocked four years off my age.

        "author": "Simon Jenkins",
        "teaser": "Within Trump’s wild exaggerations are grains of truth. Liberals have never dealt with them – and that’s why he might win again",
        "published": "Thu 7 Mar 2024 18.23 CET",
        "content": "Donald Trump is certain to be the Republican candidate in this year’s election for US president. He is also currently favourite to win. To most readers of the Guardian, I am sure this prospect is appalling, as it is to most Britons. The nation to which they gave birth and language, that has been their friend and protector down the ages, seems to be going mad.\nBritons who know the US are amazed that, however reluctantly, enough of its voters might again choose Trump to rule over them after the experience of 2017 to 2021. Who are these Americans? How can they be so blind to his faults, with the law hounding him, gossip ridiculing him and commentators pouring scorn and derision on his every word?\nThe answer is that the Americans who support Trump are not those whom most Britons know. They are elderly and rural: they are often, but by no means solely, working class and/or non-graduates. But, above all, they love Trump because they, too, are hostile to the Americans that he purports to hate.\nThese hated Americans – the language of Trump’s rallies is visceral – mostly live in big cities down the east and west coasts. They favour federal government, identity politics, social liberalism and free trade. They are led by a college-educated, liberal establishment. Of course, these are generalisations – but that is what Trump trades in.\nHis claim is that over the past two decades this establishment has corrupted the nation’s identity and bruised its essence. Using the rhetoric of a mafia boss, he declares he will smash these enemies of America. He will stop Mexicans crossing the border, with guns if need be. He will execute drug dealers, protect American families from gender politics, leave idiot Europeans to their petty wars and end Biden’s crazy foreign interventions.\nTrump is the braggart of every bar-room brawl. Most democratic leaders come to power with their rough edges softened through climbing the ladder of party politics. Not so Trump. The only experience he brought to the White House was that of New York’s property jungle, a world of rivalry, double-dealing and revenge; his favourite motto is the phrase he used in January towards his now fallen rival Nikki Haley: “I don’t get too angry, I get even.”\nA large amount of the abuse that Trump attracts from his critics disappointingly relies on raw snobbery. It comprises attacks on his dress, his manners, his vulgar houses and his coarse turn of phrase – and echoes the remarks of English toffs on the arrival of the first Labour government in Downing Street. They do him no harm in the eyes of his fans. Early comparisons with Mussolini played to his self-image as a warrior taking on an entrenched elite.\nSee it through their eyes: the US did not collapse into dictatorship under Trump. Enemies were not arrested nor hostile media shut down. Since leaving office, though, his own enemies have not stopped trying to convict and imprison him, even as the trials merely aid his cause. Colorado’s attempt to stop him running for office was as legally wrongheaded as it was counterproductive.\nThe US economy did well under Trump, better than Britain’s. He made a genuine if futile attempt to find peace in Korea. Vladimir Putin, with whom his relations remain obscure, did not invade Ukraine while he was in the White House. His recent demand that Nato and Europe reassess both their strategy and their forces was hardly unreasonable, if poorly expressed. His fixation with immigration is hardly confined to the American continent.\nThat is why Trump’s enemies would do well to look to the causes of their own unpopularity. Democracy gives no quarter. It is one person, one vote, and its believers cannot complain when the arithmetic goes against them. Trump complains that the US ruling class and its media – apart from the bits he controls – are governed by new ideologies based on gender and race. He claims they want to ban conservatism from campuses, “defund” the police and flood the country with Mexican labour and Chinese goods. There is just enough truth in these accusations to have his supporters cheering him on.\nA prominent US senator recently assured a private gathering in London that Americans would never return Trump to the White House. It was inconceivable. Those declaring for him were just “just trying to give us a fright”.\nI can only hope he is right. With the present state of things in the world, the erratic Trump should never be in a position to lead what is still, tenuously, the free world. But those who oppose him should study what makes him so popular in the eyes of most Americans – and makes them less so.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

        "headline": "Joe Biden has come out fighting. But he’ll need more than grit to defeat Trump now",
        "author": "Jonathan Freedland",
        "teaser": "With Trump surging, democracy is in peril: that’s the message Biden needs to couple with the spirit he showed in Congress",
        "published": "Fri 8 Mar 2024 18.00 CET",
        "content": "The president of the United States delivered his annual address to Congress on Thursday night – except what Americans and an increasingly nervous world wanted to assess was less the state of the union than the state of Joe Biden. I don’t mean politically, I mean physically.\nIn the week that confirmed the November election will be a rematch of the 2020 contest – the current president against the former one – Biden needed to prove he was not the doddering, even senile figure of Donald Trump’s rhetoric and a thousand social media memes. In 68 combative minutes, he cleared that bar. He ad-libbed, he took on Republican hecklers and, often at high volume, jabbed at his opponent. The result: a performance that pundits described as “feisty” and “scrappy”, free of senior moments, and which prompted even Fox News to muse that Biden seemed “jacked-up” – which, from the network that likes to depict the president as a walking corpse, was a compliment.\nProjecting vigour was essential because the mountain Biden has to climb over the next eight months is getting steeper. For one thing, this week established that Trump is not only the certain nominee of his party – crushing his last remaining challenger, Nikki Haley, in all but one of the Super Tuesday primary contests and forcing her out of the race – he is in total control of it. Republicans in Congress are supine before him, whether it’s outgoing Senate leader Mitch McConnell endorsing him this week – even though Trump has repeatedly insulted McConnell’s Taiwan-born wife in nakedly racist terms and the two men have not spoken in three years – or the Republican refusal to pass a border deal they’d agreed with Democrats, because Trump wants the issue of immigration to remain unaddressed so that he can attack Biden for failing to address it come November. Some had hoped a primary season against Republican opponents would batter and bruise Trump, weakening him ahead of the presidential election. It has not worked out that way.\nThough that was not the only Democratic fantasy to be dented, if not dashed, this week. Many have hoped Trump’s undoing will come in the courts, where he faces a staggering 91 criminal charges. Indeed, judges in Colorado (and two other states) had removed Trump from the ballot, citing the constitution’s disqualification of anyone involved in insurrection, in Trump’s case the storming of the Capitol on 6 January 2021. But on Monday, the supreme court ruled unanimously against Colorado, ensuring Trump’s place on the ballot in all 50 states.\nThe previous week, the same supreme court, now dominated by the right thanks to three Trump appointments, issued a timetable that effectively slows down the most potent of the cases against the former president: the charge that he sought to subvert the 2020 election. That makes it much less likely that there will be a conviction this side of polling day, a realisation that hits Democrats hard. For years, they’ve longed for this or that judicial authority to solve America’s Trump problem: special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into collusion between Trump and Moscow played that role for a while. Time and again, the dream evaporates. Democrats now face the awkward reality that, if they are to defeat Trump, they will surely have to do it the way they did it in 2020: with votes.\nAnd that task is looking ever harder. It’s not just the headline figures from national polls in which Trump is often ahead, or even Trump’s lead in the battleground states. It’s the change afoot in key voting groups that were crucial to Biden’s victory in the last election. Trump is gaining ground among Black and Hispanic voters, regularly picking up 20% to 25% of the former. To be sure, Biden is still ahead – but not by the massive margins he once enjoyed and which he needs to offset Trump’s advantage with white voters.\nPerhaps most alarming for Democrats is the defection of the young. Biden won voters under 30 by 25 points in 2020, now it’s neck and neck. A big part of that is the president’s support for Israel, with the appalling images coming out of Gaza outraging younger Americans especially. Mindful of them, and the disaffected Arab-American voters who could tip the balance in the critical swing state of Michigan, Biden announced a plan to create a floating pier off the Gazan coast, enabling maritime shipments of aid. Given that it will take weeks to build, and Gazans are desperate for food right now, and given too that there is obviously a simpler, swifter way to get aid in – by exerting full US pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding he stops the delays – the Democrats’ progressive wing is unlikely to be placated. Taking all these developments together, it is not too strong to say the Biden coalition is fracturing.\nMany watching from afar are dumbfounded that Americans could be prepared once again, and despite everything, to make Donald Trump their president. How can that be? Surely they remember what it was like last time? To which the answer seems to be: actually, they don’t. This week, the New York Times wondered if Americans suffer from “collective amnesia” when it comes to Trump, pointing to polling data that suggests the years 2017 to 2021 have fallen into the memory hole. It’s partly that Trump’s outrages came so often, they created a kind of numbness: people became inured. And it’s partly that, thanks to a US media polarised on tribally partisan lines, there is no agreed, collective memory of what happened during those four turbulent years, even on 6 January. Add to that the inflation and border pressures of the Biden years and, as Sarah Longwell, an anti-Trump Republican consultant and convenor of focus groups, puts it: “They know what they don’t like about Biden, and they have forgotten what they don’t like about Trump.”\nHow can Biden hope to scale the daunting peak that confronts him? Plenty say the answer is a two-pronged message, “democracy and Dobbs”: focus on Trump’s dictatorial aspirations and his role in appointing the supreme court, whose decision, known as Dobbs, ended the constitutional right to an abortion. But there’s good evidence that that formula, which paid dividends in 2022’s midterm elections, is no longer enough, especially among the young.\nBiden needs to do more. He can’t urge Americans to be grateful for what he’s achieved these last three years: they’re not feeling better off and, besides, voters are rarely grateful. Nor can he rely on memories of Trump, because those are fading. The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein is surely right when he says Biden has to let go of the past and focus on the future, framing the coming contest as “a choice between what he and Trump would do over the next four years in the White House”. Biden’s speech on Thursday nodded to that, vowing to defend social security and Medicare, while Trump eyes up a juicy tax cut for his super-rich pals – and casting himself as a decent man up against a would-be dictator.\nIt was a good start but, my word, it is a marathon climb that lies ahead. Joe Biden has lived a long life, punctuated by the severest challenges, but the one he faces now could hardly be tougher. And yet he cannot afford to fail. The world depends on it.\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "I’m working on something right now that involves reading a book I don’t understand. It’s on a topic so abstract and vast that I’ve cried several times trying to understand the first few chapters. The thing is, when I was offered this job, I knew I was temperamentally unsuited and too stupid for it. The conventional test for whether to agree to some future task is: would I want to do it if it were happening today? My answer would have been: “Absolutely not – are you crazy?” So why didn’t I say no?\nMemoirist Leslie Jamison recently wrote in the New York Times about her “Notebook of Noes”, where she lists everything she turns down (speaking gigs, magazine commissions) and what that allows her to say yes to (more time with her daughter, her partner, her writing). It was inspiring: I cannot stress how little I am in demand, but even so, there are things I should decline (work I’m too dim for) to say yes to others (spying on garden bird drama).\nI’m happy living an unexamined life as far as possible, but this situation has forced me into the realisation I’ll never get comfortable saying no until I’ve learned to hear no. Because if getting a no cuts you to the quick, triggering weeks of sulking and making you doubt your worth, you’ll struggle to dish them out.\nBut how? I’ve Googled and mainly found advice about toddlers – this says nothing good about my emotional maturity – and a blogpost from a “cuddle sanctuary” (something else I won’t be examining). Combining advice for children and cuddlers, I’ve devised a strategy. When I get a no, I should say OK – the first step to acceptance – and keep my hands and feet to myself. I need to notice my own unacknowledged expectations and any judgments I unfairly make about myself and others. I need to feel the difficult feelings, but also handle my emotions in a calm and respectful manner.

        "headline": "Why I got it so wrong on GB News – the flailing TV juggernaut that’s too rich to fail",
        "author": "Zoe Williams",
        "teaser": "The channel has posted a loss of £42m – and that highlights my naivety. With rich backers, who cares about ratings and profit?",
        "published": "Sat 9 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "I almost never worry about things I got wrong, unless the error was so egregious that every day brings fresh evidence of how wrong I was; so, hello, GB News. The channel is almost three years old, and it’s just over three years since people started worrying about its provocations: should we be calling for an ad boycott, they wondered? My line was, relax, everyone, and my reasons were threefold.\nFirst, GB News would be boring and nobody would watch it. The thing about reactionary views is that they’re nothing if not predictable. They can be incoherent, sure – and argue simultaneously that women belong in the kitchen, and that women’s rights are so fundamental that transgender rights are anathema – but you can always guess which way they’re going to go. Who’d ever want to watch that? I was right, to a degree: the viewing figures were laughable, initially, climbing year-on-year to “respectable fringe”. But I was wrong on a more fundamental level, in conceiving this as regular, commercial broadcasting, whose aim is to win viewers and turn a profit. Even as its viewing numbers have climbed, financially its losses have soared – this week, it posted an annual £42m loss, nearly 40% more than it lost last year. The one thing GB News doesn’t worry about is money.\nSecond, I thought Ofcom would come down harder on bias: the whole point of the channel was, if not to replicate Fox News, at least to speak to that imagined constituency, which would be an impossibility under the UK’s quite strict impartiality regulation. In fact, Ofcom often finds against GB News, not just the more florid events – the “clearly and unambiguously misogynistic” conversation between Dan Wootton and Laurence Fox, both of whom have since left the channel – but also in more workaday matters, such as the legitimacy of a panel discussion on last year’s budget in which only Conservative MPs (Esther McVey and Philip Davies) and their acolytes were involved. These rulings don’t seem to leave a trace of shame – the channel ploughs on, impassive, and the individuals leave for even fringier pastures, blasting the “Ofcommunists” (copyright Dan Wootton).\nThird, I thought that Andrew Neil, the founding chairman, whatever his views, had too much respect for basic news values to helm an enterprise that peddled untruths, or was so biased as to amount to misinformation, or was technically shonky and intellectually thin. I was right about that, and Neil left after three months. But I was wrong to think that mattered: his departure, again, left no shadow of embarrassment.\nMy naivety was immense, but first, the stupidity: I wasn’t following the money. I was basically looking at a gold rush going, “that won’t take off, who wants to stand in a puddle all day waving a sieve?” Well, people who think there’s gold there, idiot. Backers of the parent company, All Perspectives Limited, including the hedge funder Paul Marshall, plough scores of millions into this loss-making enterprise every year. Is it a vanity project, or a means of donating massive amounts – £660,000 since its launch – to the insurgent wing of the Conservative party without going through the regular channels?\nIt does more than keep rebel Tory MPs solvent; it identifies them, musters them, supplies them with cheerleaders, amplifies them and renders them unignorable, both to the media as a whole and the scant remnants of sane Conservatism there are in parliament. It doesn’t matter how many viewers the channel has, because what are viewers for except, via advertising, money – and that’s the one thing GB News already has. It moves the discursive dial every day, using nothing more complicated than money. It is too rich to fail.\nIt’s salutary to compare the fortunes of rebel Tory MPs with those of the now-forgotten Labour discontents who went off to start Change UK. Similarities: Change UK was also unprepossessing, its press conferences were embarrassing, it was shifty about its programme (it said it was the amorphous “change”, it meant “get rid of Corbyn”). But those Change UK MPs were no worse than the GB News favourites; plus, at least when they did racism, it was by accident. It wasn’t because they were less skilled that their party sank without a trace. If someone had given it a TV channel and poured millions into it, it would still be with us today. To repurpose the over-quoted exchange between Fitzgerald and Hemingway, the hard right is different from you and me. It’s got more money.\nThe naivety, though, was the more important error: I thought television – yes, even rolling magazine-format current affairs – was about cultural appetite, determined by us, the ragtag army of British people. We don’t always agree, but when we do, we want to see Danny Dyer talking about David Cameron with his trotters up, and we want to name a boat Boaty McBoatface. We do not want to see Lee Anderson smearing Sadiq Khan. Not even quite committed Islamophobes want that; natural sense of fair play and all that.\nBut this kind of TV, this kind of politics, doesn’t care about your cultural appetite. Where was the appetite for any of its talking points, from small boats to trans rights to extremism poisoning public life? How is it possible, when you can’t reliably put dinner on the table, for food not to be your top priority? It isn’t possible, because it isn’t true; yet salience is being determined by financial elites, who have so strengthened Tory insurgents that now the party is nothing but insurgents, while the Labour party does nothing but respond to that insurgency.\nIt’s interesting that when any individual, whether it’s Anderson or Fox, flies the kite too far, they can be cut loose by the party or the channel without a second thought; the big names are dispensable, just grist to the project. Again, the hard right is different from you and me. It has a different agenda, of course; a different vision for society; different conceptions of loyalty and belonging; and different priorities, which is to say, upside down priorities in which the least salient get the most attention. But still, most of all, it’s got more money.\nZoe Williams is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
