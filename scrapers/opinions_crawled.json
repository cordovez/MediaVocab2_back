        "content": "An election year is the time to confront the paralysing gloom and declinist thinking besetting our country and, by rediscovering our moral compass, inaugurate a new age of hope.\nThe British people long to feel part of a shared national endeavour. But instead, near-zero growth is giving birth to a zero-sum mentality, a belief that you can only do better if at someone else\u2019s expense. Young people \u2013 historically the most optimistic about the future \u2013 yearn to believe in something bigger than themselves, yet this generation is fast losing faith in the very idea of progress. But the most devastating twist in this doom loop is the one created by rising poverty, the despair and divisions it causes, and the mounting public concern about its impact on our social cohesion. To break out of this downward spiral, Britain needs a reason for optimism \u2013 and a good starting point is a new partnership to end destitution and poverty that, by bringing charities, companies, communities and government together in a common national project, shows the United Kingdom can be united in more than just name.\nFor these are desperate times for today\u2019s poor children. That 4.3 million children \u2013 a number equivalent to four cities the size of Birmingham \u2013 were last week declared to be below the official poverty line is shameful enough, but on the ground we are now witnessing types of penury we once imagined we had consigned to history. Children now form 1.5 million of the 6 million people enduring \u2018very deep\u2019 poverty, living not only below the standard breadline, drawn at 60% of the typical income, but below 40%. One million children are thought to have had a recent brush with \u2018destitution\u2019, defined as being without the absolute basics: keeping warm, dry, clean, housed and fed.\nLast night, 140,000 children were homeless, and 1.1 million youngsters tried to go to sleep without a bed of their own; it is estimated that 2.6 million children are missing out on meals. No society can or should be at ease when children are being brought up in houses without heating, kitchens without cookers, bedrooms without beds, floors without floor covering, or toilets without toilet roll or soap. And all the evidence is that, unless we act, things will get even worse.\nBut how to fix it? Three seismic shifts have unfolded over the last decade. First, the welfare safety net has been systematically shredded, with the government abandoning responsibilities taken for granted since 1945. Second, charities and food banks, which have taken over from universal credit as the last line of defence, are exhausted and justifiably angry about having to pick up the pieces with insufficient resources. They even fear their desperate relief efforts could provide cover for the government walking further away. Third, unsure how they fit into a poverty-free, pollution-free future, the corporate sector has in the last decade donated less, not more. Yet the many business leaders who are now championing a greater sense of environmental and social responsibility know they can, and should, play a bigger role.\nWith Jeremy Hunt now hinting at an autumn mini-budget, this government has a last chance to break with the past decade and offer hope to millions by setting out a firm timetable for abolishing destitution and ending extreme poverty.\nThere can be no ducking the changing nature of the poverty we are addressing. A generation ago, worklessness was the overwhelming cause. Today, nearly three poor children in four live in a working household and no government can perpetuate the myth any more that the majority of our poor people are workshy or part of a dependency culture. Alongside a root-and-branch review of universal credit to reflect this, we should be raising the pay floor, creating new opportunities to climb the career ladder including through better skills (today only one in six on low pay ever escape low pay), and rewiring the various markets \u2013 for utilities, travel, rented housing and childcare \u2013 that are currently skewed against poorer families. We should offer NHS help to those who are sick and economically inactive to restore their fitness before delivering any lectures on laziness.\nBut action cannot await reviews and phased reforms, however necessary. Were the government to declare the end of poverty to be a national goal and set clear deadlines, there would be a way out of the current emergency. Then it could credibly invite charities, corporations and community and civil society groups to join a time-limited partnership to alleviate poverty now. Only then will it be understood that the shared goal is not to for ever fall back on food banks in place of the necessary long-term solutions, but to create immediate breathing space as government transitions us away from mass poverty.\nWithin the bounds of the fiscal envelope, government can build on the \u00a31bn a year that has until now been allocated to the household support fund. A start could be made with between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a33.3bn found by imposing a similar reserve requirement on banks that the European Central Bank, the Swiss and others currently do (and we once did), thus hypothecating for poverty eradication a small fraction of what banks currently receive in interest payments on their balances at the Bank of England.\nBy simplifying the Gift Aid system, \u00a3700m of ancillary relief, which currently can end up being back with higher-earning donors, can go straight to good causes. And the Chancellor\u2019s autumn statement could also offer additional time-limited tax incentives to encourage more giving. The top 1% donate overall just 0.2% of their income \u2013 that\u2019s just \u00a3538 a year from average incomes of \u00a3271,000. But if that top 1% were incentivised to donate just 1%, \u00a31.4 billion a year could be raised for good causes.\nSome companies take corporate philanthropy seriously, but overall their donations represent just 0.8% of the pretax profits of FTSE 100 companies. But even if the real value of their donations had remained at its level of ten years ago, good causes would now be at least \u00a35bn better off.\nFor the period of this current emergency, companies should consider donating more of their surplus products \u2013 and so reduce pollution as well as poverty. But if they cannot give free of charge, they should offer to sell to charities essential goods \u2013 toothpaste, nappies, toilet rolls, soap and shampoo, as well as food \u2013 at production cost or less.\nIf we share the discounted cost, and if families are referred through social workers, teachers, health visitors and GPs as well as food banks, we would be getting vital goods to those too impoverished to buy, and doing so in the most cost-effective way. Indeed, in the pilot phase of the new Multibanks \u2013 which sit alongside food banks and are food, clothes, bedding, toiletries, furnishings, and baby banks rolled into one \u2013 every \u00a31 donated has procured supplies worth \u00a35 in value.\nThis partnership is not a permanent or comprehensive solution. It would be a one- or two-year transitional arrangement, which would only succeed if the government offers benefit improvements that exceed the value of what others provide in kind. It would not be the end of poverty, but it is the signal the whole country needs: the beginning of the end. It would address the costs crippling families now, and create the headroom in which to fix our welfare safety net. With communities, charities, companies and government working together to deliver a shared national goal, we can rapidly banish destitution, and support the 2,600 food banks in their ambition to make themselves redundant \u2013 and a divided country can find unity, and hope, again.\nGordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"

        "content": "Creating a better public transport system will be vital for meeting Labour\u2019s economic goals and its environmental ones; and it would make for a much nicer country, too. Getting there from here, though, will be a long and difficult journey. After 14 years of Tory mismanagement, with growth low and interest rates high, it may be harder to splash the cash than it would have been in the past. The next Labour government should focus on the following.\nA full and immediate commitment to reverse Rishi Sunak\u2019s ruinous decision to scrap the northern half of Britain\u2019s largest rail project seems unlikely to get the nod from Rachel Reeves\u2019 Treasury team, but the case for a new line remains as strong as ever. It isn\u2019t just, or even mainly, that it\u2019ll provide faster links between UK cities \u2013 it\u2019ll add capacity to an overcrowded system, and by getting fast trains off the slow lines it will allow operators to run more regional and local trains. Without it, lower fares, less crowded trains and significant reductions in the domestic air market will all be impossible.\nThe UK will build a new north-south line sooner or later, and it would be cheaper, faster and more logical to finish the one that\u2019s already been started rather than beginning again. The key for now, then, is to keep that door open. The manifesto should promise to protect the route for the future and therefore make the land it would require less attractive to potential developers: that should make it harder to sell, and maximise the amount of the route that remains in government hands. Doing this would signal Labour\u2019s immediate prudence and its longer-term ambitions, in contrast with the Tories\u2019 reckless record.\nIn much of the country, rail actually makes up a relatively small share of public transport usage. Non-drivers are instead reliant on buses, a mode of transport deregulated everywhere but London \u2013 allowing private firms to not only run, but plan services \u2013 by the Thatcher government in 1986. This has meant a more skeletal and less useful network.\nA Labour government will not immediately be able to arrest austerity, but it should make \u201cfranchising\u201d \u2013 the ability of local government to plan a network, even if private companies operate it \u2013 a competence available to all county or combined-authority local governments. We know that it is possible: London has always run its buses this way, Manchester and other northern cities are moving in that direction now, and the Scottish government recently legislated to offer such powers to its own councils. Rolling this out would allow the rest of the country to brand and plan bus networks around social value rather than profit \u2013 to make buses easier to use, and to use the fares from busy routes to subsidise vital but less popular ones.\nThis may be less flashy than, say, a new generation of tram networks \u2013 but such things are, alas, expensive. Better buses are the most cost-effective way to rebuild our public transport network, and to ensure those who can\u2019t or don\u2019t wish to drive can access economic and cultural opportunities. It can double as a step towards returning councils to their purpose of building their communities, rather than simply managing cuts on behalf of central government.\nOne big reason why rail is not the main mode of transport in so much of the country, of course, is the aforementioned lack of rail capacity. To at least begin addressing that, one area for which Labour should find capital funding as a matter of urgency is the north\u2019s rail network.\nThe Tories funded the Ordsall Chord, which links Piccadilly and Victoria stations in Manchester and allows trains to cross the city; but it declined to deliver the rest of the \u201cnorthern hub\u201d plan, such as new through platforms to allow more trains to run through Piccadilly rather than terminating there. The attempt, since 2018, to timetable services as if this was enough to deliver the capacity increase that was originally promised has merely meant pushing more trains through a bottleneck. The result has been half a decade of cancellations that \u2013 since Manchester is the hub of the entire northern rail network \u2013 have made it impossible to rely on rail right across the region.\nA new Labour government should work with local authorities and the rail industry to find a solution to the region\u2019s capacity problems, and commit to funding it. To show it wouldn\u2019t repeat the errors of the current government \u2013 such as Network North, a hastily drawn up map of projects that were unfunded, cancelled, or sited as far away as Plymouth \u2013 it should consider devolving control of the scheme to Transport for the North or the Greater Manchester combined authority. The problem with the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d was never the idea, but the people delivering it. Labour has an opportunity to remind people who the party of the \u201cred wall\u201d really is.\nJonn Elledge\u2019s new book, A History of the World in 47 Borders: The Stories Behind the Lines on Our Maps, is published in April"

        "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "It\u2019s difficult to disentangle Labour from my sense of self. Grew up in Stockport, looks a bit like Macaulay Culkin, bad dress sense \u2026 the Labour party always seemed to fit in there somewhere. My great-grandfather, a railwayman who had his wages docked in the General Strike nearly a century ago, was a Labour councillor. So was my grandmother; her proudest achievement was stopping a family being evicted by a private landlord over Christmas. My parents met at an open-air Labour meeting outside Tooting Bec in the 1960s (romantic). My mother bought me a Labour membership as a 15th birthday present. Under every Labour leader in my 21 years of adult life, I\u2019ve plumped for the party\u2019s candidates at local, national and European level, and campaigned for them to boot.\nAnd yet, after a uniquely calamitous 14-year stretch of Tory rule, just as Labour looks set to reconquer No 10 by a landslide, I\u2019ve just emailed the party cancelling my membership. My committed critics will understandably seek to link the two: Labour has shed its aversion to electability, and off sulks Home Alone\u2019s patron saint of unelectable ideas.\nBut my decision isn\u2019t based on a desire to see Labour for ever in the wilderness. Reaching it has been a gradual, painful process of realising the party won\u2019t even do the bare minimum to improve people\u2019s lives, or to tackle the crises that have led Britain to catastrophe; and that it will, in fact, wage war on anyone who wants to do either\u2013 making anyone with politics to the left of Peter Mandelson feel like a pariah on borrowed time. Yes, my relatives had conflicted relationships with the party, and were often frustrated by its insufficient radicalism. But they could always point to policies that transformed the lives of the people Labour was founded to represent, from the welfare state to the minimum wage and the NHS, where my grandmother worked for her whole life.\nThe premise of Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership bid in 2020 was that popular policies such as taxing the rich to invest in public services, scrapping tuition fees and promoting public ownership were not to blame for the party\u2019s 2019 electoral rout. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s 2017 election manifesto, Starmer declared, was the party\u2019s \u201cfoundational document\u201d \u2013 centred around such commitments and credited with the party\u2019s biggest surge in vote share since 1945, even if it wasn\u2019t enough to win two years after a shattering defeat. \u201cJeremy Corbyn made our party the party of anti-austerity,\u201d Starmer told shattered Labour members, \u201cand he was right to do so.\u201d Though I didn\u2019t vote for him, his pitch gave hope for the broad church my ancestors believed in. In response, I wrote a column titled: \u201cStarmer can succeed, and he deserves our support.\u201d\nYet five years on, Labour has become a hostile environment for anyone believing in the very policies Starmer relied upon to secure the leadership. Sure, Tony Blair\u2019s leadership bid didn\u2019t include laying waste Iraq, but he didn\u2019t pretend to be a slicker version of Tony Benn either. \u201cCircumstances changed,\u201d plead Starmer\u2019s defenders. Weird, then, that according to Margaret Hodge, she was led to believe by a Starmer ally during the leadership election that he was \u201clying\u201d in order to get the job. Weird, too, that during that same campaign Starmer told Andrew Neil that nationalisation of utilities would feature in a Labour manifesto, but 18 months later said: \u201cI never made a commitment to nationalisation.\u201d\nAh, the luxury of a Guardian columnist, goes the predictable retort, demanding the most vulnerable pay the price for his lofty principles. Consider, though, that ending the two-child benefit cap would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, and lessen the effects of poverty on a further 850,000, but Starmer backed keeping it anyway. Why? To sound tough, presumably. On who? Impoverished children, like those I grew up with in Stockport? This is the same Labour party that has ruled out bringing back a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses or instituting a wealth tax. The same Labour party committed to Tory fiscal rules that lock the country into dismal austerity policies that have delivered collapsing public services and an unprecedented decline in living standards. The same Labour party that gutted its one distinctive flagship policy, a \u00a328bn-a-year green investment fund, not because it came under pressure, but because it feared it might.\nSome argue that Labour is doing a Clark Kent, and will unveil its hidden progressive Superman upon assuming office. Yet those fiscal rules make that approach impossible, even if you disregard the propensity of Labour governments to become more rightwing in office.\nThe assault on Gaza, the great crime of our age, adds moral indecency to the pile of dishonesty and vacuity. When Starmer declared Israel had the right to cut off energy and water to Palestinian civilians, he did so as a human rights lawyer who understands the Geneva conventions. After letting shadow cabinet ministers defend him, he claimed it \u201chas never been my view that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines\u201d. We all have political red lines: mine is supporting what would amount to war crimes against innocent civilians, toddlers and newborn babies among them, then gaslighting the public over doing so.\nWhere is my gratitude for Starmer delivering a now inevitable landslide victory, you may ask? Well, he didn\u2019t force Boris Johnson and his cronies to violate their own pandemic rules, or to trash the NHS, or oversee the worst squeeze in living standards in history. Nor did he propel to power Liz Truss, whose unhinged economic experiment crashed the economy \u2013 the moment when the electorate turned on this Tory party for good.\nThe absolute power a landslide victory will give Labour should scare you. When Starmer allies deployed antisemitic tropes \u2013 with one joking about a \u201crun on silver shekels\u201d when two Jewish businessmen missed out on peerages, and another calling a Jewish Tory donor a \u201cpuppet master\u201d \u2013 an apology was deemed to be sufficient. When another racially abused a journalist and had a sexual harassment complaint upheld, they were reinstated after investigation.\nContrast this with Diane Abbott, Britain\u2019s first Black female MP, who was suspended after immediately apologising for an Observer letter in which she argued that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people are not subject to racism \u201call their lives\u201d. She has been left in limbo for 10 months and counting while the party investigates \u2013 only for Labour to use the racist abuse directed at her by a Tory donor for political capital, while still refusing to reinstate her.\nAnother fellow leftwinger, Kate Osamor \u2013 again, a Black female MP \u2013 was suspended for describing the assault on Gaza as a genocide on the day the international court of justice placed Israel on trial for alleged genocide. Questions of racism, then, seem to be judged on whether they have a factional use \u2013 a sure sign of moral bankruptcy. This leadership style is crude in opposition; with an overwhelming majority, it will be chilling.\nThat is why I think those who believe in real change from the Tories\u2019 bankrupt model should vote for Green or independent candidates. A new initiative \u2013 We Deserve Better \u2013 is raising money to support such candidates, judged on whether they believe in, say, taxing the well-off to invest, or public ownership, or opposing war crimes, even if they differ on this or that. Those seeking transformative policies are now fragmented, but they don\u2019t have to be. The premise of this new initiative is simple: if the left doesn\u2019t band together, the only pressure on Labour will come from the migrant-bashing, rich-worshipping right.\nThe Tories\u2019 chance of winning is infinitesimally small. What matters now is whether anyone who wants to redistribute wealth and power is denied a voice in Starmer\u2019s administration. That is certainly the ambition of his lieutenants. When inevitable disillusionment with a government rooted in deceit and lacking any solutions to Britain\u2019s woes seeps in, it will be the radical right that stands to benefit.\nSo bid me farewell, even cry \u201cgood riddance\u201d, but before you do, ask yourself: what do you think will happen next?\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\nGuardian Newsroom: What is Labour\u2019s plan?

        "teaser": "The Israeli PM\u2019s refusal to heed US demands on food aid for Gaza is morally indefensible, hurting the president \u2013  and opening the door to Donald Trump",
        "published": "Fri 22 Mar 2024 18.41 CET",
        "content": "The pictures out of Gaza get more harrowing with each passing day. After months of witnessing civilians grieving for loved ones killed by bombs, now we see children desperate to eat \u2013 victims of what the aid agencies and experts are united in calling an imminent \u201cman-made\u201d famine. What matters most about these images is their depiction of a continuing horror inflicted on the people of Gaza. But they also reveal something that could have lasting implications for Israelis and Palestinians, for Americans and for the entire world. What they show, indeed what they advertise, is the weakness of the president of the United States.\nJoe Biden and his most senior lieutenants have been urging Israel to increase the flow of food aid into Gaza for months, in ever more insistent terms. This week the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, cited the finding of a UN-backed agency that the threat of hunger now confronted \u201c100% of the population of Gaza\u201d, adding that this was the first time that body had issued such a warning. Earlier this month, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, told Israel it needed to do whatever it took to get humanitarian aid into Gaza: \u201cNo excuses.\u201d The Biden administration is all but banging the table and demanding Israel act.\nA week ago, it seemed to have had an effect. The Israel Defense Forces announced what was billed as a \u201cdramatic pivot\u201d, promising that it would \u201cflood\u201d Gaza with food supplies. But there\u2019s precious little sign of it. An additional crossing has been opened, the so-called 96th gate, allowing a few more trucks to go in, but nothing on the scale that is required to avert disaster \u2013 or mitigate the disaster already unfolding. For all the talk of a pivot, there is still \u201ca series of impediments, blockages, restrictions \u2026 on lorries carrying the most basic humanitarian aid\u201d, David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee said this week. He noted the way that Israel\u2019s ban on \u201cdual use\u201d items, those things that could be used as weapons if they fell into the hands of Hamas, means that even the inclusion of a simple pair of scissors for a clinic can result in an entire truckful of aid being turned back.\nTo repeat, the victims of this are the 2.2 million people of Gaza, who don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from. But it represents a severe problem, or several, for Biden too. The most obvious is that he is in a re-election year, seeking to reassemble the coalition that brought him victory in 2020. Back then, a crucial constituency was the young, with voters under 30 favouring Biden over Donald Trump by 25 points. Now it\u2019s a dead heat. To be sure, there are several factors to explain that shift, but one of them is younger Americans\u2019 outrage at the plight of Gaza.\nThe threat to re-election is illustrated most sharply in the battleground state of Michigan, home to 200,000 Arab-Americans who are similarly appalled, with many unequivocal that they will not vote for Biden, even if that risks the return of Trump \u2013 with all that implies for the US and the world. That number is more than enough to tip the state from Democrat to Republican in November. \u201cIf the election were held tomorrow, I think Biden would lose Michigan,\u201d veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told me on the Unholy podcast this week. For Biden, \u201cthis is a pain point\u201d.\nUS support for Israel in this context would be a headache for any Democratic president, but Israel\u2019s willingness to defy its most important ally presses especially on Biden. For one thing, the upside of his great age is supposed to be his experience in foreign affairs and especially his personal relationships with fellow world leaders. He likes to say he has known every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir and that he\u2019s dealt with Netanyahu for decades. Critics reply: a fat lot of good it\u2019s done you.\nAnd that is the heart of the matter. For most of Israel\u2019s history, it\u2019s been taken as read that a clear objection from a US president is enough to make an Israeli prime minister change course. A shake of the head from Dwight Eisenhower brought an end to the Suez war of 1956. A phone call from Ronald Reagan ended the Israeli bombardment of west Beirut in 1982. In 1991, George HW Bush pushed a reluctant Likud prime minister to attend the Madrid peace conference, by withholding $10bn in loan guarantees.\nBiden has repeatedly made his displeasure known, and yet Netanyahu does not budge. It\u2019s making the US look weak and for Biden especially, that\u2019s deadly. \u201cThe subtext of the whole Republican campaign is that the world\u2019s out of control and Biden\u2019s not in command,\u201d David Axelrod, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, told me on Unholy . \u201cThat\u2019s basically their argument, and they use age as a surrogate for weakness.\u201d Every time Netanyahu seems to be \u201cpunking\u201d Biden, says Axelrod, it makes things worse.\nPlenty of Israeli analysts suggest that appearances are deceptive. In their view, Netanyahu is making a great show of thumbing his nose at Biden, because he is in an undeclared election campaign and defiance of Washington plays well with his base, but in reality he is much more compliant. In this reading, Team Netanyahu\u2019s talk of a ground operation in Rafah \u2013 where nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are crammed together, most having fled Israeli bombardment \u2013 is just talk. Yes, the Israeli PM likes to threaten a Rafah invasion, to put pressure on Hamas and to have a bargaining chip with the Americans, but he is hardly acting like a man committed to doing it. Amos Harel, much-respected defence analyst for the Haaretz newspaper, notes that there are only three and a half IDF brigades currently in Gaza, compared with 28 at the height of hostilities. \u201cNetanyahu is in a campaign, and for the time being at least, \u2018Rafah\u2019 is just a slogan,\u201d he told me.\nLet\u2019s hope that\u2019s right, and a Rafah operation is more rhetorical than real. That does not address Israel\u2019s foot-dragging on aid, which Netanyahu is clearly in no hurry to end, in part because his ultranationalist coalition partners believe sending food to Gaza is tantamount to aiding the Hamas enemy.\nThat leaves Biden with two options. His preferred outcome is a breakthrough in the talks in Qatar, which would see both a release of some of the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October and a pause in fighting, allowing aid to flow in. But Netanyahu fears such a pause, which would hasten the day of reckoning for his role in leaving Israel\u2019s southern communities so badly exposed six months ago to Hamas \u2013 whether that reckoning is at the hands of the electorate or a commission of inquiry. He prefers to play for time, ideally until November, when Netanyahu hopes to say goodbye to Biden and welcome back Trump.\nThe alternative for Biden is tougher. Last month, he issued a new protocol, demanding those countries that receive US arms affirm in writing that they abide by international law, including on humanitarian aid. If the US doesn\u2019t certify that declaration, all arms sales stop immediately. In Israel\u2019s case, the deadline for certification is Sunday.\nJoe Biden does not want to be the man who stopped arming Israel, not least because that would leave the country vulnerable to the mighty arsenal of Hezbollah just across the northern border with Lebanon. His administration is split on the move and he may well deem it too much. But he does need to see food flood into Gaza, right away. He has tried asking Netanyahu nicely. Now he needs to get tough.\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"

        "content": "Last week, a news story broke about the sheer impossibility of everyday living for millions of people all over the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average monthly rent paid by private tenants rose by 9% in the year to February, which is the largest annual increase since records began nine years ago. The average monthly rent in England is now \u00a31,276 and \u00a3944 in Scotland. If you are unfortunate enough to be renting from a landlord in London, your monthly outgoings may well appear hopelessly unrealistic: there, average monthly rents have risen by 10.6%, to a truly eye-watering \u00a32,035. Given that the median UK monthly wage currently sits at about \u00a32,200, the dire affordability crisis all this points to is glaringly clear.\nEverything, moreover, is woven through with a very British sense of the market\u2019s base cruelty: late last year, an investigation by the Observer found that the rents paid by tenants in the wealthiest parts of Britain had gone up by an average of 29% since 2019, whereas for people living in the most deprived areas, the figure was a mind-boggling 52%.\nIn our cities, skyrocketing rents are partly a subplot of the pandemic and its long tail: younger people either continued to live with their parents or moved back home during lockdowns, but are now returning to independent living en masse, thereby causing a spike in demand. At the same time, a crazy rental market and the impossibility of buying somewhere to live seem to be convincing existing tenants to stay put, meaning that supply is being choked off. The result \u2013 which is also playing out in the suburbs \u2013 is a vicious circle, exacerbated by thousands of landlords and letting agencies shoving up rents for both new and existing tenants, simply because they can.\nThe picture in more rural areas may be even more extreme. In 2023, one study claimed that private rents in the English countryside had gone up by an average of 27% in a single year. Again, the pandemic is relevant here: many out-of-town housing markets started to drastically change when families joined the great Covid migration out of urban places. The rampant conversion of homes into Airbnb-type holiday lets has only worsened the resulting pressures. In these places, one of the most obvious results is a quiet epidemic of rural homelessness, reportedly up 40% since 2018.\nAll told, whole swathes of our housing arrangements are in a state of flux, and with social housing still marginalised and property ownership off limits for millions of people, a private-rented sector that cannot cope with the resulting situation has long since turned dysfunctional. In England and Wales, around 5m households now live in private rented housing, up from less than 2m 25 years ago. Age-wise, the proportion of people who are tenants peaks at around 30% among 25- to 34-year-olds, although the number of people over 65 in such housing is reckoned to have increased by about 55% over the past decade. But the share of the national conversation given over to this part of housing policy is still pitifully small: the result, perhaps, of the stupid idea that renting is either something you do in your 20s, or the shameful last resort of older people who are down on their luck.\nThe old Tory vision of the property-owning democracy might be a nice idea, but it has long distorted and misdirected the politics of housing. If people in power fixate on the kind of homes that are bought and sold, the rental sector tends to look not like a part of the social fabric that needs to be reformed and improved, but something people should simply be encouraged to leave. Meanwhile, everything is further distorted by a plain fact that tends to go unmentioned. According to the campaign group 38 Degrees, nearly one in five Tory MPs are also private landlords, something else that makes our politics look almost Dickensian.\nThe sense of almost Victorian neglect is only heightened by how much these issues intersect with poverty. Around 1.9m households in the private rented sector receive an element of universal credit based on the so-called local housing allowance (LHA), which is meant to cover the cheapest third of rents in any given area. LHA was frozen in 2020, leaving rents to soar away from what people could afford. Late last year, Jeremy Hunt used his autumn statement to belatedly announce that it will rise, by an average of around 17%. But that does not solve any of the fundamental problems, for two obvious reasons. First, unless the LHA is uprated every year, it will inevitably fall behind increases in rents. Second, research suggests that even increased local LHA rates will not cover the asking rents for anything like the share of rental properties the government suggests: according to the property consultancy Savills, just 8.5% of such housing will actually be affordable for the relevant people.\nWhat a mess this all this. Nearly a quarter of private rented sector homes are still estimated to fail the decent homes standard. Arbitrary evictions seem to be soaring beyond control. The government\u2019s milquetoast renters reform bill, which was at least meant to outlaw that practice, has reportedly been waylaid by Tory interventions about \u201cthe rights of landlords\u201d, and may not make it through parliament before the election. In Scotland, the end of emergency rent caps and eviction protections for private renters at the end of March is forecast to cause huge problems: housing campaigners say they are already seeing cases of tenants being served with notice of rent increases of as much as 60%. The Labour party, in theory at least, has come up with a renters charter with solid and enduring protections for tenants, and plans to improve the standards of rented properties. There again, when Keir Starmer was asked last week if he supported the London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s drive to introduce modest rent controls, he gave a very characteristic answer: \u201cThat\u2019s not our national policy.\u201d\nAnd so here we are. We all know the essential nature of the contemporary British condition: that unending sense that nothing is reliable, even as we are told to shell out more and more money. The crisis in private rented housing might be the most grimly perfect example to date: the cost of one of life\u2019s most basic essentials endlessly going up, while the people who have to pay get no corresponding increase in everyday security and stability. These are the kind of things that eat away at what used to be called the social contract. If they are not fixed, the anger and resentment that has recently washed through our politics may only be the start.\n John Harris is a Guardian columnist"

        "author": "Dan Saladino",
        "teaser": "The lack of diversity could mean the fruit\u2019s extinction. It offers a stark warning of what could happen to other key foods",
        "published": "Fri 22 Mar 2024 13.00 CET",
        "content": "The meeting of the World Banana Forum last week in Rome didn\u2019t make many headlines. But what was under discussion there has serious implications for everyone. The ubiquitous yellow fruit is the proverbial canary in the mine of our modern food system, showing just how fragile it is. And the current plight of the banana should serve as an invitation to us all to become champions of food diversity.\nWhen you peel a banana, you\u2019re on the receiving end of a near-miraculous $10bn supply chain. One that sends seemingly endless quantities of a tropical fruit halfway across the world to be among the cheapest, most readily available products in supermarket aisles (on average, around 12p a banana). But, incredibly, there\u2019s no inbuilt backup plan or safety net if the one variety that most of the global trade depends on starts to fail.\nThe most striking point made at this year\u2019s forum came in a seemingly innocuous comment in the event\u2019s opening speech. The director general of the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation, Dr Qu Dongyu, questioned why, with more than 1,000 known varieties of banana, the world mostly depends on just one, a species called the Cavendish. That needs to change, he said, hinting that we are all part of the problem.\nMost people don\u2019t question why every banana they\u2019ve ever eaten looks and tastes pretty much the same. Most of us will never try a blue java from Indonesia with its soft, unctuous texture and flavour of vanilla ice-cream, or the Chinese banana that is so aromatic it\u2019s been given the name go san heong, meaning \u201cyou can smell it from the next mountain\u201d. The demand for low-cost, high-yielding varieties has resulted in vast monocultures of just one type of globally traded banana, and this is true of many other crops as well. Homogeneity in the food system is a risky strategy, because it reduces our ability to adapt in a rapidly changing world.\nUnlike wild bananas, which grow from seed, every single Cavendish is a clone, the offspring of a slice of the plant\u2019s suckers growing below ground. This means it has no way of evolving, so it can\u2019t adapt to new threats that arise in the environment. Panama disease, also known as fusarium wilt, is whipping through monocultures of Cavendish bananas in Asia, Australia, Africa and, most recently, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the source of 80% of the world\u2019s traded bananas. Just a few spores carried on a spade or even on clothing is all it takes to contaminate a plantation, and growing the Cavendish on that land is no longer an option.\nOne solution in the face of this devastating disease is to use genetic modification or gene-editing to develop bananas with greater resistance. James Dale, a professor at Queensland University of Technology, spent decades working on a modified version of the Cavendish designed to be \u201chighly resistant\u201d to the variant of Panama disease that\u2019s attacking the Cavendish. But Dale believes it\u2019s not a magic bullet. The long-term answer, he thinks, is to bring greater diversity into the food system.\nDuring the research for my book Eating to Extinction, a conversation with Dale proved revelatory. Monocultures do not exist in nature, he told me, and we need to learn lessons from this. Much greater diversity used to exist in the global food system. But in introducing a smaller number of highly productive crops, this diversity was lost. In response to this, scientists at the UK\u2019s leading crop research centres, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) in Cambridge and the John Innes Centre in Norwich, are working to bring diversity back into the fields using genetics from heritage varieties that were pushed to the brink of extinction by modern varieties.\nScientists are looking at other precarious crops, such as coffee, which is made up of varieties that emerged from just a handful of plants sent around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries. The climate crisis is making the future of the coffee species we depend on \u2013 arabica and robusta \u2013 look bleak. This is why botanists at Kew have identified viable and delicious alternatives from the more than 120 other coffee species around the world. The most promising is Coffea stenophylla, a species found in Sierra Leone that almost went extinct in the 1950s.\nAt a policy level, there are reasons to be optimistic. At Cop15, held in December 2022 in Montreal, 196 countries signed up to the Global Biodiversity Framework. The headline pledge is to save 30% of nature on land and sea by 2030, part of which includes urgent action to \u201chalt extinction of threatened species\u201d. Less well known is the fact that these threatened species also include domesticated ones, referring to the 7,000 or so plants humans have used for food over millennia.\nAnd there are farmers\u2019 initiatives such as Wildfarmed, which is experimenting with a wider range of wheat varieties. The flour is already finding its way on to the high street through major retailers and nationwide pizza chains. Meanwhile, in the east of England, Hodmedod\u2019s, a business set up by three food and farming researchers, is looking back to what was grown in Britain during the iron age and reviving neglected varieties of grains and pulses, including carlin peas and emmer wheat.\nBut if Qu Dongyu is right that a big problem is the lack of \u201cacceptance by retailers and consumers of different varieties\u201d, we all need to step up. We need to let it be known that we want greater diversity. This rallying call could be as simple as buying a variety of bean or pea we haven\u2019t tried before, an unusual type of wheat, or even \u2013 if one were to appear in store \u2013 a different banana.\nDan Saladino is a food journalist, broadcaster and author of Eating to Extinction: The World\u2019s Rarest Foods and Why We Need to Save Them"

        "author": "Boff Whalley",
        "teaser": "Why do populists so often use the work of artists who despise them? Because they don\u2019t have any good songs of their own",
        "published": "Sat 23 Mar 2024 08.00 CET",
        "content": "The beauty of writing a song that revolves around a universal idea is that people feel like it could be theirs: it voices the way they\u2019re feeling. The first time I heard my band Chumbawamba\u2019s hit Tubthumping played at the ground of my local football club, I was standing at the urinal in the toilet underneath the stands, pissing the afternoon away with scores of other blokes, ready for the match. I walked up to my seat and watched people singing along to what had instantly become, in that moment at least, their song.\nTubthumping belongs to the guests at the wedding who sing it in celebration. It belongs to the Italian anti-fascists who sing it in defiance on a demonstration. It belongs to cancer patients going through chemotherapy, seeing every successful bout of treatment as a personal victory. I know that all these people have taken the song as theirs, because they write to tell us. This is how songs become \u201cfolk songs\u201d: songs that belong to our shared histories, not to a single version performed by a single artist.\nThere are hundreds of songs like this, songs that feel as if they belong to us all. When we sing Fairytale of New York at Christmas, the let\u2019s-all-join-in spirit of it isn\u2019t the sole property of Shane, Kirsty and the Pogues \u2013 it\u2019s our song, too.\nBut there\u2019s a problem with these universal songs \u2013 they can be hijacked by people who clearly don\u2019t understand the spirit in which they were written, and want to use them to aggrandise themselves, or to sell ideas that aren\u2019t universal at all. It\u2019s like baking a cake and declaring to the room: \u201cHere, have a slice, the cake is for all of us!\u201d And some greedy bastard grabs five or six slices and scurries off into a dark corner, sniggering. And to stretch that analogy, the greedy bastard is the person that, noticeably, never turns up with his own cake for everyone to share.\nBecause that\u2019s the thing with songs, with literature, with art, theatre, cinema, with most of the beautiful, creative, cultural things we love \u2013 they are very rarely created by those on the political right. The bigots don\u2019t have any good songs of their own.\nWhich brings me to New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister Winston Peters and his use of Tubthumping. The man is clearly modelling himself on the recent upsurge of populist politicians, these ultra-wealthy men somehow getting to claim to be \u201cof the people\u201d. Across the globe, from Italy to Sweden and from Jair Bolsonaro to Donald Trump, these self-styled \u201coutsiders\u201d are gaining power and popularity using slogans that appeal to ordinary people, slogans that make no sense when you put them in the mouths of millionaire careerists. Their rhetoric is anti-elite, and yet they clearly and definably are the elite. Their popularity depends upon them playing at being just like you and me, the good guy at the bar who buys you a drink while you\u2019re watching the football, who tells you the reason the country is going down the drain isn\u2019t because of the multibillionaire corporate hoarding of the world\u2019s wealth but because \u2026 cue a culture-warrior rant about immigration and snowflakes and experts and \u201cI did my own research\u201d.\nLet me be clear: the song Tubthumping was written to celebrate the resilience and tenacity of working-class folk who keep fighting when the chips are down. It has nothing whatsoever in common with wealthy politicians with extremist anti-liberal agendas.\nThere have been many, many examples of rightwing populist leaders using ostensibly leftwing music to hoodwink their audiences into some kind of hypnotic self-delusion that they are \u201cof the people\u201d. The Conservative party has a history of being called out for singing and playing songs by leftwing artists at its annual party conference. From a rendition of John Lennon\u2019s Imagine in the Thatcher years (is it possible to be that oblivious to irony?) to a more recent use of M People\u2019s Moving On Up (apparently the song\u2019s co-writer, Mike Pickering, was \u201cvery angry\u201d), it\u2019s as if these careerist politicians think we won\u2019t notice that their jukebox is stuffed full of songs by artists who despise them and their ideas.\nFormer Tory prime minister David Cameron listed one of his favourite songs as the Jam\u2019s Eton Rifles which prompted the Jam\u2019s Paul Weller to retort \u201cWhich bit didn\u2019t you get? \u2026 It wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.\u201d When Cameron also admitted to liking the Smiths, guitarist Johnny Marr said simply: \u201cStop saying that you like The Smiths, no you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s as if the new breed of populist leaders think they can hide their multimillionaire \u201cman of the people\u201d contradictions behind such universally loved songs. Trump is particularly ignorant when it comes to his choice of campaign songs; he\u2019s been forced to stop using music by artists including Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, the Beatles and Elton John. Chumbawamba had to send our own \u201ccease and desist\u201d when a pre-president Trump thought he could use Tubthumping without realising we would loudly object. Which all makes it all the more obvious that, simply, the right doesn\u2019t have any good songs. That\u2019s why they keep trying to nick ours.\nBoff Whalley is a musician and writer, and the former lead guitarist of Chumbawamba"

        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 20.24 CET",
        "content": "\u201cPeople who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones\u201d is a phrase that must be ringing in the ears of Tory party campaigners. They were caught spreading election disinformation against Labour\u2019s London mayor on the day that Conservative ministers accused Chinese hackers of meddling in democracy by targeting Beijing\u2019s opponents in the UK.\nThe Conservative party did delete footage of a panicked crowd at a New York subway station, which it used to falsely state that London had become a \u201ccrime capital of the world\u201d, after online criticism. But the rest of the video, with its spurious claims, remained up on Tuesday evening.\nSadiq Khan, who is standing for re-election for a third term as London mayor this May, rightly condemned the Tory video as lies and misinformation. The Conservative party is resorting to underhand tactics and fake news because it has an uninspiring candidate, Susan Hall, in London and is far behind in the polls. In January, the Tories posted an attack video on social media that misrepresented comments by Mr Khan to make it look as if he was proud to be antisemitic. The Conservative party shamefully refused to take it down.\nIt would be easy to dismiss the campaign advert as simply ludicrous. But it is also dangerous in its embrace of conspiracy-minded tropes, some of which are popular among the far right. It claims that masked Ulez enforcers, represented by a shadowy figure in a dark alleyway, are \u201cterrorising communities\u201d, and that the Ulez policy is \u201cforcing people to stay inside or go underground\u201d.\nMr Khan lives under 24-hour police protection. But the threat from disinformation is not only to him. The mayor warned that AI-generated audio which purported to capture him making incendiary remarks about Remembrance weekend last year almost caused serious disorder after it was widely shared by the far right. Fake news can \u2013 thanks to social media \u2013 spread as never before. This makes it far more dangerous. Political deepfakes, if left unchallenged, could have profound implications for journalism, voter ethics, and the quality of democracy.\nPerhaps the Tories hope that many will share their fake videos because, even though voters know the content is false, the stories stir up resentment. The Tory party has long seeded these clouds. Mr Khan is England\u2019s most high-profile Muslim politician, but he has not been defined by his faith. This has not stopped his opponent, who has falsely told fellow Tories that Jewish Londoners were frightened of Mr Khan\u2019s \u201cdivisive attitude\u201d. An investigation into Ms Hall\u2019s social media posts found she had repeatedly endorsed racially charged abuse of Labour\u2019s mayor.\nThe Tory party has also attempted to create more favourable terms for itself in London, a Labour stronghold, by changing from a preferential voting system to first past the post. This was a step back for electoral reform, but combined with voter ID requirements, it made Mr Khan\u2019s return to office harder. But so does his incumbency.\nThe social costs of virally spreading false information are real. In Europe, the posting of anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook has been correlated with violent attacks on refugees. Voters are also worse off when they believe false statements because disinformation has made it almost impossible for them to choose high-quality candidates. If we want a democratic society with policies that respond to evidence, then we must pay attention to the changing character of propaganda and develop suitable responses.\n This article was amended on 27 March 2024. An earlier version referred to \u201ca proportional voting system\u201d where \u201ca preferential voting system\u201d was meant."

The takeaway seems to be this: the carbon-belching construction of 79,000 sq metres of office space, the demand for which is unproven, matters more to them than the production of sustainable energy with estimated carbon savings of 11,000 tonnes a year.\n\u201cLondon may not survive another four years of Sadiq,\u201d yelled the Daily Telegraph last week. This followed other recent warnings that \u201cCanada\u2019s descent into tyranny is almost complete\u201d, that cyclists have turned Paris into \u201chell on earth\u201d, that western economies have been \u201cdestroyed\u201d, that Britain is irrevocably on a \u201croad to serfdom\u201d, that Nato cannot be fixed, that horse racing faces an existential threat from gambling controls. Its catastrophism is at least even handed: heat pumps, which the Telegraph doesn\u2019t like, are \u201cdead\u201d; the Conservative party, which it mostly supports, faces an \u201cextinction-level event\u201d.\nTo use a reference its readers would get, it is the Private Frazer of British newspapers \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re doomed \u2013 doomed!\u201d as the Hebridean soldier-undertaker from Dad\u2019s\u00a0Army used to say.

It isn\u2019t \u2013 just the mushrooms grown with peat, to protect plover and dragonfly habitats. (And the Trust\u2019s tearooms have sourced alternatives grown in other ways.) This tells you all you need to know about the obsessive campaigns against the Trust run by opaquely funded rightwing thinktanks and their allies in the press \u2013 in particular, how much they are rooted in reality.\nSo it was good to hear the historian and national treasure Mary Beard, while giving the Trust\u2019s Octavia Hill lecture last week, take apart some of the moaners\u2019 pet peeves. A derided 2020 report into links between National Trust properties and colonisation and slavery was, she said, \u201cstating the bleeding obvious\u201d. The installation of a disco ball in Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire is a harmless, and easily reversible, way of engaging children, while also highlighting that its revered interiors were originally party spaces. \u201cThe pomposity and self-righteousness\u201d of the attackers, she said, \u201cis best responded to by a bit of a giggle\u201d. We should be grateful\u00a0to mushroomgate for\u00a0giving us that.\nIt\u2019s almost possible to admire the brass neck of the\u00a0developers who, frustrated by the presence of a listed former hospital on a site in Birmingham, propose to perch a 440ft\u00a0tower over it.\nMight it, conceivably, become a beloved piece of David-and-Goliath urbanism, like the former Wickhams department store in the East End of London, where the two-storey premises of Spiegelhalters jewellers, its owners having refused to sell up, pops up incongruously in the giant Ionic colonnade of what was hoping to be a cockney\u00a0Selfridges?\nConceivably, it might, but probably not. To judge by the way that towers like this are almost always built, it would lack the grace and joy to pull off a giant architectural joke, which would leave it looking like nothing but a cynical ploy.\n Rowan Moore is the Observer\u2019s architecture critic"

These films place queers at their centre, and invite others to follow without watering anything down for taste. \u201cWhat would I say?\u201d says Ayo Edebiri as Josie in Bottoms about a girl she fancies. \u201cHow\u2019s your boyfriend? How\u2019s his penis?\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t sapphic film\u2019s first rodeo in the mainstream. In the 2010s, lesbian films were definitely having a moment. After the mammoth success of Todd Haynes\u2019 Carol in 2015, itself following Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s Blue Is the Warmest Colour in 2013, others followed suit: The Handmaiden (2016), Disobedience (2017), The Favourite (2018), Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019), Ammonite (2020). Brilliant, exciting, sexy films about women falling in love and having stolen kisses and spitting into each other\u2019s mouths. But many of these films were also tragic, serious, bleak period pieces, in which women were fighting for their love against the odds \u2013 often with cataclysmic consequences.\nThis new wave is a lot less moralistic, a lot less tragic and a lot sillier in general. Because lesbians don\u2019t just go around giving each other pained furtive glances, hiding their sexuality like a sordid secret. We can also be amoral, and shameless, and make horny jokes about dildos. In Bottoms, the two main characters aren\u2019t particularly bothered about their sexuality \u2013 apart from the fact that it\u2019s preventing them from getting laid because they can\u2019t tell which girls would go down on them. In Drive-Away Dolls, Margaret Qualley\u2019s Jamie is a \u201cfuckboy\u201d who sees no problem in kicking her best friend out of the motel room so that she can shag. This is a far cry from the corset-tight films of earlier years, in which our sapphic characters often find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nIt makes sense that this new sapphic wave would happen now, in the 2020s, when conversations about representation are starting to feel tired and hackneyed. When nearly a third of American Gen Z adults now identify as LGBTQ+, and since the proportion of people identifying as straight in the UK has steadily declined, it is no longer enough just to see lesbians or queer women on screen. We want to see all versions of queerness, in the same way that we\u2019ve always seen all versions of straightness, in movies for us, not just about us. (It\u2019s worth noting that Love Lies Bleeding, Bottoms and Blue Jean are from queer women directors, and Drive-Away Dolls was co-written by a queer woman).\nSome people might struggle to appreciate Love Lies Bleeding. They won\u2019t get the appeal of Lou wishing to chomp down on Jackie\u2019s toes, or the satisfying thwack of moving aside a man who\u2019s trying to invade your queer date. They won\u2019t get Love Lies Bleeding in the same way that I didn\u2019t get Oppenheimer (men talking about bombs), or any of the Bond films. But that\u2019s the joy of the movies. We get to swap gazes, embody characters, try their versions of the world. And in Love Lies Bleeding, their version of the world was \u2013 deliciously, fantastically, hilariously \u2013 also my own.

        "headline": "Paris school head resigns after death threats over Muslim veil row",
        "published": "Agence France-Presse in Paris",
        "content": "French politicians from across the spectrum have expressed dismay over the resignation of a Paris school principal who had received death threats after asking a student to remove her Muslim veil on the premises.\nIn a show of support, prime minister Gabriel Attal, a former education minister, was set to receive the principal late on Wednesday, his office said.\nSecularism and religion are hot-button issues in France, which is home to Europe\u2019s largest Muslim community.\nIn 2004, authorities banned schoolchildren from wearing \u201csigns or outfits by which students ostensibly show a religious affiliation\u201d such as headscarves, turbans or kippas on the basis of the country\u2019s secular laws, which are meant to guarantee neutrality in state institutions.\nThe headteacher\u2019s departure comes amid deep tensions in the country after a series of incidents including the killing of a teacher by an Islamist former pupil last year.\nThe head at the Maurice Ravel lyc\u00e9e in eastern Paris quit after receiving death threats online following an altercation with a student last month, officials told AFP.\nIn late February he had asked three students to remove their Islamic headscarves on school premises, but one of them refused and an altercation ensued, according to prosecutors. The head later received death threats online.\nAccording to a letter sent by the school to teachers, pupils and parents, the principal stood down for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d, while education officials said he had taken \u201cearly retirement\u201d.\nIn a message addressed to the school\u2019s staff, quoted by French communist daily L\u2019Humanit\u00e9, the principal said he had taken the decision to leave \u201cfor his own safety and that of the school\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Bruno Retailleau, the head of the right-wing Republicans faction in the Senate upper house, said on X on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t accept it,\u201d Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist deputies in the National Assembly lower house, told television broadcaster France 2, calling the incident \u201ca collective failure\u201d.\nMarion Mar\u00e9chal, granddaughter of far-right patriarch Jean-Marie Le Pen and a far-right politician herself, spoke on Sud Radio of a \u201cdefeat of the state\u201d in the face of \u201cthe Islamist gangrene\u201d.\nMaud Bregeon, a lawmaker with President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, also took aim at \u201can Islamist movement\u201d.\n\u201cAuthority lies with school heads and teachers, and we have a duty to support this educational community,\u201d Bregeon said.\nSocialist Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo called the principal to \u201cassure him of her total support and solidarity\u201d, said her office, adding she was \u201cappalled and dismayed.\u201d\nThe student lodged a complaint against the principal, accusing him of mistreating her during the incident. She told French daily Le Parisien that she had been \u201chit hard on the arm\u201d by the principal.\nThe student is an adult who was at the school for vocational training.\nThe Paris public prosecutor\u2019s office told AFP on Wednesday that her complaint had been dismissed.\nAt the same time, an investigation was opened into cyber-harassment after the death threats against the head.\nIn a further show of support, the education ministry said in a statement that it would never abandon teachers in the face of threats.\nThe ministry said that \u201call teams\u201d remained mobilised, adding that the principal\u2019s decision to leave his post was \u201cunderstandable given the seriousness of the attacks against him\u201d.\nEducation minister Nicole Belloubet visited the school in early March and deplored the \u201cunacceptable attacks\u201d.\nA 26-year-old man has been arrested for making death threats against the principal on the internet. He is due to stand trial in April."

        "headline": "The left is smeared as the angry mob again and again. In reality, it is the target of political violence",
        "author": "Andy Beckett",
        "teaser": "These threats don\u2019t just seek to intimidate leftwing politicians, it makes them seem a risk to voters, too",
        "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 11.00 CET",
        "content": "In Britain and other supposedly calm democracies, the ascent of leftwing politicians can arouse unusual fears of violence. Many conservatives and centrists associate the left with mobs, intimidation and revolutionary struggle. For some on the right, leftwing politics of any sort is a kind of violence, with the upsetting of the traditional order that it promises.\nSuch fears are not always groundless. But more often they are exaggerated, sometimes deliberately, in order to smear the left as fanatical and dangerous. In reality, the left always contains plenty of pacifists and other principled opponents of the use of force \u2013 life\u2019s \u201cherbivores\u201d, as the writer Michael Frayn called them in a perceptive 1963 essay.\nInstead, what violence there is around the left, whether rhetorical or real, is often directed the other way, against the left\u2019s own representatives. \u201cShe should be shot,\u201d concluded the Tory mega-donor Frank Hester\u2019s horrible rant against Diane Abbott, who after 37 years as an MP remains one of the best-known socialists in the country.\nHester\u2019s racism and misogyny have rightly received huge condemnation. Yet less attention has been paid to the extremity of what he said he wanted to happen to Abbott, and less still to the effect of such violent fantasies on the left as a whole. Is talk of violence against the left just an expression of conservative anger, nasty but with no serious political consequences, or is it something more?\nProminent British socialists have always received death threats. Tony Benn got them regularly throughout his decades as an MP, particularly in the 1970s and 80s when he seemed about to acquire significant power as a minister or Labour deputy leader. Sometimes the threats were sent to his wife, Caroline. \u201cWe regret that your husband is going to be killed and that you will be a widow, but it is in the public interest,\u201d said one letter in 1975, which claimed to be from a group of businessmen called the Defenders of Private Enterprise.\nWell-known leftwingers have been physically assaulted. In 1981, Ken Livingstone, the then leader of the radical Greater London Council, was grabbed and sprayed in the face with red paint. In 2019, Jeremy Corbyn had an egg smashed on his head by a Brexit supporter. Such incidents have generally been treated by the media as minor, almost meaningless. Yet they form part of an ominous pattern. Shortly after the egg-smashing, a video appeared on Twitter (now X) of British soldiers in Afghanistan using a poster of Corbyn for target practice. In 2017, a man from Cardiff with far-right views, Darren Osborne, drove a rented van into a crowd near a mosque in Corbyn\u2019s constituency, killing one man. Osborne had originally planned to kill the Labour leader himself.\nFor the politicians targeted, this mixture of serious threats, actual attacks and hostile play-acting can be intimidating, anxiety-inducing or just depressing. In his diaries, Benn often tried to brush off the death threats as ridiculous rightwing fantasies. But sometimes he admitted to being deeply unsettled. In 1981, the New Statesman printed a story about an alleged plan to kill him two years earlier, involving the Tory MP and close ally of Margaret Thatcher, Airey Neave, and a former MI6 agent, Lee Tracey. Benn later saw Tracey on an episode of Panorama about the security services, and recorded that he felt as if \u201cI was watching my potential assassin. It was a very strange feeling.\u201d No inquiry into the alleged plot followed.\nBeyond the individual victims, the broader effect of violence against the left, whether real or rhetorical, is to make leftwing politicians seem a risk. If you elect them, and especially if they gain positions of national power, violence may follow, voters are in effect warned. As British politics has become more confrontational since the mid-2010s, a wider range of MP\u2019s have become targets, most horribly the centre-left Labour MP Jo Cox and the Tory MP David Amess. But the left remains a favourite target. Along with Abbott, one of those in parliament receiving the most violent abuse is the young leftwinger Zarah Sultana.\nAs much as it\u2019s possible to identify the perpetrators in an era of easily anonymised social media, most of the threats appear to come from the political fringes. Yet the main beneficiaries of this climate of fear may turn out to be centrist, relatively bland and therefore less provocative politicians \u2013 however much they themselves may genuinely be appalled by political violence.\nThis is a country where many voters and political journalists revere \u201cmoderates\u201d and dislike \u201cextremists\u201d, especially those on the left. It can be argued that the threat of violence against radical MPs acts as another form of political discipline, keeping rebellious figures such as Abbott isolated and on the margins, where only the bravest fellow MPs are prepared to join them.\nBritain\u2019s self-image as a peaceful place, however much violence it has visited on other countries, and however much violence is in its own history, means that the role of violence in its politics is usually played down. To look into threats against leftwing MPs, like showing an interest in the threats to our democracy from rightwing authoritarians in the 70s and more recently, is to risk being seen as paranoid, ghoulish, a bit obsessive.\nYet as the Hester episode shows, violent sentiments can be expressed by people very close to power, seemingly without serious consequences for their political and commercial activities. Meanwhile, peaceful protesters are increasingly sent to prison. Where a country draws the line between acceptable and unacceptable politics is always very telling.\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "Israeli settlers call for UN agency\u2019s closure in Jerusalem protest",
        "published": " and ",
        "content": "Dozens of Israeli settlers and rightwing activists have protested by again blocking the entrances of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) office in Jerusalem and calling for the body\u2019s closure.\nLast week, Israel announced it would no longer approve Unrwa food convoys to the north of Gaza, where the threat of famine is highest. The decision came after the agency was accused by the government of collaborating with Hamas in Gaza, with its staff facing a systematic campaign of obstruction and harassment by the Israeli military and authorities, as revealed in internal UN documents seen by the Guardian.\nUnrwa was founded in 1949 to provide healthcare, food, and education to Palestinian refugees, with 5.9 million of them relying on its services. It employs about 30,000 Palestinians, 13,000 of them \u2013 mostly teachers \u2013 in Gaza.\nOn Wednesday, a group of settlers, activists, and members of the rightwing extra-parliamentary political group Im Tirtzu staged a protest for the third week in a row, fixing posters to the building and demanding that the agency be abolished.\n\u201cUnrwa needs to be disbanded,\u201d said Aynat Libman, a 52-year-old Israeli settler from Efrat. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t need to provide space to Unrwa in our capital. They support terror, teach children from a very young age to be terrorists, provide support to Hamas, and supply Hamas. They are terrorists.\u201d\nIsrael has accused Unrwa staff members of participating in the 7 October attack and called the agency \u201ca front for Hamas\u201d.\nThe UN has launched an internal and an independent investigation but has said Israel has not provided it with any evidence to support the claims against its staff.\nA US intelligence assessment of Israel\u2019s claims that UN aid agency staff members participated in the 7 October attack reportedly assessed with \u201clow confidence\u201d that a handful of staff had taken part, indicating that it considered the accusations to be credible but that it could not independently confirm their veracity. It cast doubt, however, on accusations that the UN agency was collaborating with Hamas in a wider way.\nThe protesters expressed their anger over the UN resolution on the ceasefire in Gaza, describing it as an attack against Israel.\n\u201cThe UN and [Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d added Libman. \u201cThey are antisemitic, and there is no other way to say it.\u201d\nRightwing supporters and settlers have previously attempted to block aid trucks from entering Gaza at the Nitzana border crossing, and this is not the first time settlers and rightwing activists have targeted the UN agency by placing threatening posters on the main entrance and calling for it to be shut down.\n\u201cWe want the Israeli government to expel Unrwa from Israel,\u201d said Roei Ben Dor, 21, from Gedera. \u201cUnrwa is Hamas; their workers are affiliated with Hamas. We should be in Gaza, not just because of Hamas but because Gaza is ours. We have every right to take Gaza, to take Rafah. This is our land.\u201d\nAmong the protesters was Aryeh King, a deputy mayor of Jerusalem and a prominent advocate for settlements.\n\u201cWe need to transfer all of them [all Palestinian residents] out of Gaza,\u201d King said. \u201cBecause Hamas is the people of Gaza.\u201d\nJuliette Touma, the director of communications for Unrwa, said: \u201cFrom time to time, groups of rightwing settlers come to our headquarters shouting insults at our staff. This must be stopped. We are a UN agency and deserve respect.\u201d\nUN staff working with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced obstruction and harassment from the Israeli military and authorities since the conflict in Gaza began five months ago, according to internal UN documents obtained by the Guardian.\nThe documents record hundreds of incidents ranging from the alleged blindfolding and beating of UN staff at checkpoints to the use of UN facilities by Israeli troops as firing positions during raids on refugee camps in which Palestinians were killed.\nAfter the Israeli government\u2019s decision to prevent the agency\u2019s aid deliveries in northern Gaza, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, condemned the move, calling it intentional obstruction of lifesaving assistance during a human-made famine.\nGaza faces dire humanitarian conditions as a result of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October.\nLast week a UN-backed food security assessment warned that famine was projected to hit the north of Gaza by May unless there was urgent intervention. Unrwa has not been able to deliver food to the north since 29 January, Touma said.\nMartin Griffiths, the head of the UN humanitarian coordination office, said Unrwa was the \u201cbeating heart of the humanitarian response in Gaza\u201d.\n\u201cThe decision to block its food convoys to the north only pushes thousands closer to famine,\u201d he added. \u201cIt must be revoked.\u201d\nGuardian Newsroom: The unfolding crisis in the Middle East\nOn Tuesday 30 April, 7-8.15pm GMT, join Devika Bhat, Peter Beaumont, Emma Graham-Harrison and Ghaith Abdul-Ahad as they discuss the fast-developing crisis in the Middle East.

        "headline": "Judges who belong to the Garrick have a choice: play fair by women, or stand down from rape and sexism cases ",
        "author": "Karon Monaghan",
        "teaser": "Judging requires an appearance of neutrality. But members of this elitist club are signalling their commitment to patriarchy",
        "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 15.12 CET",
        "content": "Nobody sensible believes that judges do not bring their prejudices to work but we, as lawyers, and no doubt the public, expect that judges will make an effort to keep them hidden.\nMost judges will have to decide a sex discrimination case or preside over a rape or sexual or domestic violence trial at one time or another in their career. When they do, they may well have to remind themselves and sometimes juries of the position of women in society, and counter gender stereotypes that might otherwise influence the outcome of the case. These stereotypes might be those that associate women with certain forms of work, caring for children or doing \u201cwomanly\u201d things (like not going out drinking in cosy clubs in the evening), or gender-related rape myths that blame women for men\u2019s sexual assaults upon them. Judges are supposed to do this \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d.\nBut the publication this week of the names of a number of judges who are members of the Garrick Club casts doubt on the inclination or ability of some of them to keep to this promise. The revelations come as no surprise to many lawyers and, indeed, other judges. Many past and present members of the judiciary are members of the Garrick, and the legal profession has always known this to be the case. From time to time, there are grumblings; some lawyers argue that judges should be prohibited from joining men-only clubs.\nLeaving aside gut feeling \u2013 the general queasiness at the image conjured up by the words \u201cprivate gentleman\u2019s club\u201d (whether Spearmint Rhino or the Garrick) \u2013 even lawyers sometimes struggle to pinpoint quite what is wrong with them. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to single-sex clubs. Women should be allowed to meet without the interruption of men. Lesbians should be able to have their own places in which to socialise and mobilise. Single-sex spaces are important, especially given that women often experience hostility or harassment in mixed-sex environments.\nBut the Garrick is not an ordinary club, and herein lies the problem. It is not a club where men with a shared heritage, or gay men, for example, meet for solidarity or for comfort. The Garrick is different. It is a place where powerful men hang out, forge relationships and work out who they can trust. Women lose out on the opportunity (should they wish to take it) of making those relationships and engendering trust among those they wish to have trust them. But more fundamentally, judges being members sends a message, including to female lawyers and judges, that powerful places are manly places.\nIt is not clear how you join the Garrick or, apart from being male, what the criteria are for membership. Its homepage tells the reader that its entry requirements are strict: \u201cIt would be better that 10 unobjectionable men should be excluded than one terrible bore should be admitted.\u201d This, we are told, means \u201cthe lively atmosphere for which the Club was so well-known in the 19th century continues to invigorate members of the Club in the 21st century\u201d.\nPerhaps the more than a third of members who obstructed the efforts of some who sought to have its constitution amended to admit women (a two-thirds majority being required) thought women who might have an interest in joining would not be sufficiently entertaining. Or perhaps they relied on prejudiced ideas about women\u2019s wittiness, competence, or trustworthiness. Or perhaps they simply did not want women, including female lawyers and judges, to enter a space reserved for the powerful. We cannot know. Nor do we know who voted to keep women out. Not that that would be any excuse. Serious dissatisfaction with a club\u2019s rules can easily be dealt with by relinquishing membership. We can take it that those who continue to be members do so content in the knowledge that their professional peers are excluded because of their sex.\nThis tells us a lot about those whose membership was exposed by the Guardian\u2019s Amelia Gentleman this week: from senior politicians to civil servants. But for judges there is an additional problem. Judging requires the appearance of neutrality. Membership of a club that functions to foster relationships between men at the centres of power, and that bars women from entry as members (though not presumably as cleaners and cooks), sends a message of partiality: a commitment to patriarchy.\nThe apparent determination by members of the judiciary to hang on to membership means that the criticism that is lobbed at them from time to time is not enough. Judges who are members of the Garrick should not be presiding over cases where sex or gender is a focal point in the case, as in discrimination cases and sexual and domestic violence cases. They cannot be trusted to be impartial or at the very least to be seen to be so.\nIf they cannot trust women to sit with them in the clubby corridors of power, we cannot trust them to do the right thing by women. Advocates must now seriously consider whether in some cases it might be appropriate to ask a judge whether he is a member of the Garrick and, if so, to ask that he recuse himself so that justice can be seen to be done.\nKaron Monaghan KC is a barrister specialising in equality and human rights law"

        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 13.17 CET",
        "content": "The same vessel that hit the Baltimore Francis Scott Key Bridge on Tuesday, destroying it and sending people and vehicles tumbling into the water, was also involved in a collision while leaving the port of Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016.\nAccording to Vessel Finder and the maritime incident archive Shipwrecklog, the Dali \u2013 a 948ft (290-meter) cargo ship with a capacity of 10,000 containers \u2013 was leaving the container terminal of Antwerp heading to Bremerhaven.\nAs it did so, its bow reportedly swung around, causing the stern to scrape the side of the quay, significantly damaging several meters of the hull.\nThe ship was reportedly detained by authorities afterward and docked in Deurganckdok, Belgium. There were reportedly no injuries or adverse pollution.\nAccording to Vessel Finder, the weather was fine at the time, and the incident was reportedly blamed on the ship\u2019s master and pilot on board.\nA ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner\u2019s own.\nFor a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.\nFor crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers' Federation.\nPanama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an \u201copen registry\u201d, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.\nThe practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.\nKaren McVeigh, senior reporter\nIt is unclear what crew were aboard the ship. Vessel Finder said at the time that the ship, which was built in South Korea in 2015 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, was owned by the Greek company Oceanbulk Maritime but was chartered by Maersk.\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) confirmed on Tuesday that the Dali was registered in Singapore and had 22 crew on board, with Maersk adding in a statement that the crew were all Indian but none of them were Maersk crew or personnel. It said the ship was operated by the charter vessel company Synergy Group.\nMaersk has been approached for comment.\nAbout 2.6km (1.6 miles) of the Baltimore bridge collapsed on Tuesday when the Dali crashed into it, causing a number of vehicles to fall into the Patapsco River below. At least seven people were being searched for with two rescued, including one in critical condition, officials said on Tuesday at a pre-dawn press conference."

        "headline": "Look at streets and open spaces: where are all the children? Blame the war on play",
        "author": "Harriet Grant",
        "teaser": "It\u2019s said that youngsters are addicted to tech \u2013 but their childhoods are also being shaped by the loss of child-friendly areas",
        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 12.00 CET",
        "content": "Something has gone seriously wrong for children in the UK. On the radio, in the papers, among friends; everyone is talking about the epidemic of childhood unhappiness and anxiety. Smartphones, social media, and easy access to violent content and pornography are, of course, part of it. The rising tide of anger at under-regulated tech companies is justified. But there has been another huge change to childhood in recent years \u2013 the almost total loss of children and their play from the streets and neighbourhoods around us.\nChildren and their games, their scooters, their chalks and bouncing balls have vanished, replaced by speeding traffic and parked cars. And in losing doorstep play, children have lost the hours of exploration and physical activity that nature designed them to seek out in order to thrive. This, along with the slow erosion of time for play in schools and the austerity-driven closure of youth spaces, is profoundly changing childhood.\nI know this because for the past five years I have been reporting around the country on the war on play. It\u2019s a war that, sadly, children and the adults fighting for them are in danger of losing.\nIn 2019, I reported on the scandal of segregated playgrounds. Developers on several new-build estates in London were deliberately blocking children in social housing from shared play spaces and gardens. The segregation was appalling, and led to widespread political condemnation. But I believe it was only possible because of a much deeper injustice.\nPlay was already starting to be seen as a form of antisocial behaviour. Children and their play have been pushed off the streets and estates where they grow up, through increased traffic and a \u201cno ball games\u201d culture. With other communal spaces no longer home to crowds of children, it became easy to segregate the tiny spaces allotted for play.\nThe government cannot continue to ignore this issue. Yesterday saw the final session of a parliamentary inquiry into children, young people and the built environment. MPs on the select committee that scrutinises the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities have been hearing evidence since January on how we can plan and develop for children\u2019s needs rather than against them.\nYesterday, the inquiry questioned the minister for planning Lee Rowley. He and the government\u2019s chief planner, Joanna Averley, were pressed repeatedly on why children are missing from planning guidance. \u201cWe know they are less important than bats,\u201d pointed out the MP for Dover, Natalie Elphicke.\nBut both Averley and Rowley stuck to their guns. Children, said Rowley, do not need any further mention in planning. \u201cYou could then say disabled people need mentioning, or people from certain geographic areas.\u201d His priority, he said, is to get homes built.\nSo that\u2019s the government view: more homes, and no mention of children in planning. Rowley added, \u201cAs far as I can see, things have improved for children in terms of play provision \u2013 I can\u2019t provide evidence but I\u2019m sure they have.\u201d And with that comment, he dismissed the pages of evidence presented to the inquiry that shows the vanishing of children from their own streets in recent years \u2013 and the huge cuts to local authority play budgets.\nI gave evidence in the first session alongside Alice Ferguson, co-founder with Ingrid Skeels and Amy Rose of Playing Out, the parent-led movement that started with just one play street in Bristol and has grown into a national campaign to restore children\u2019s freedom to play out near home. It is partly down to their dogged lobbying that this inquiry is taking place. This is real people power \u2013 from play streets to parliament.\nAs thousands of homes and new developments spring up around the country, change is urgently needed. The National Planning Policy Framework mentions lorries more often than children \u2013 newts and bats are better protected than play.\nTwo other key experts in this area are the architect Dinah Bornat and writer Tim Gill. Both are advocates of child-friendly design, working with leading developers to promote doorstep play and neighbourhoods where children are free to move around, safe from traffic. But in the February evidence session, led by Labour MP Clive Betts, both made stark warnings that children are \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d in planning.\nWhat campaigners would like to see come out of this fiasco is a cross-departmental approach to consider children\u2019s needs in every area of public life. This could be led by a cabinet level minister for children.\nIn terms of planning \u2013 all new developments should be child-friendly, and existing neighbourhoods adapted with child-friendly measures.\nHousing associations and local councillors need clear guidance to refer to so that when they get complaints about play (and they do get these complaints), they can write back, stating clearly that children have a right to play near their own homes.\nAgain and again, I have seen the impact of this lack of consideration in children\u2019s lives.\nI recently wrote about residents on the Bells Gardens Estate in Peckham. Southwark council ran out of money after ripping out their playground during redevelopment, and have left the site covered in rubble.. There is no law or policy that protects play spaces in situations like these.\nJust down the road in New Cross, south London, children at Kender primary school waited several years while the Peabody housing association used their much-loved park to store building materials. While at a high-end development near Tower Bridge, I met families living in social housing flats who were sent warning letters for letting their children play in the corridors.\nIn Rhyl, one of the poorest parts of Wales, developers working for the council ripped out a much-loved playground to make way for flood defences, with local families complaining of a \u201cshameful\u201d lack of consultation. A furious local resident wrote to me \u201cthe impact of the development on local sea life was discussed more than the impact on children\u201d.\nThis extends beyond local government and developers. It seems we have turned against play across society. When the Guardian did a call-out on the barriers children face playing outside, families told us of threats from neighbours and even of police being called about children for playing outside.\nSo while it is true that being online is harming children\u2019s mental health, we need to also focus on what children do actually need \u2013 and that is as much free outdoor play on their doorsteps as possible.\nHarriet Grant is a freelance reporter specialising in human rights and social affairs"

        "content": "Donald Trump mocked the former Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel, for her firing by NBC days after being hired as a political analyst.\n\u201cWow!\u201d the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, who ejected McDaniel from the RNC in favour of his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\u201cRonna McDaniel got fired by Fake News NBC. She only lasted two days, and this after McDaniel went out of her way to say what they wanted to hear. It leaves her in a very strange place, it\u2019s called NEVER NEVERLAND, and it\u2019s not a place you want to be.\u201d\nMcDaniel\u2019s hiring was announced by NBC last Friday. Interviewed on Meet the Press on Sunday, she disavowed Trump\u2019s lie that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election but also claimed there were electoral \u201cproblems\u201d in battleground states.\nProtests from on-air talent and an NBC union group also concerned McDaniel\u2019s combative relations with the press in seven years as RNC chair, a period coinciding with Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican party. On Tuesday evening McDaniel was gone \u2013 giving her a four-day NBC career, not the two claimed by Trump.\nCesar Conde, chair of NBCUniversal News, told staff: \u201cNo organisation, particularly a newsroom, can succeed unless it is cohesive and aligned. Over the last few days, it has become clear that this appointment undermines that goal.\u201d\nTrump said: \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY, and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK. They were BROKEN and EMBARRASSED by LOW RATINGS, HIGHLY OVERPAID, \u2018TALENT.\u2019 BRING BACK FREE AND FAIR PRESS.\u201d\nOther rightwingers, and media figures, cried foul too.\nHugh Hewitt, a talkshow host, told Fox News: \u201cI have never seen anything this brutal since I got started in media in 1990.\n\u201cRonna is going to sue everyone who defamed her, for breach of contract, for intentional infliction of mental distress. They are going to sue for the destruction of her business opportunities that come from being on TV. I think they made a terrible decision, and they allowed the MSNBC bleed to take over their network.\u201d\nOn NewsNation, the former Fox News correspondent Geraldo Rivera accused the MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow of \u201cmalignant wokeism\u201d, saying: \u201cGod did not anoint her the arbiter of who was appropriate for her network to hire or what their point of view is.\u201d\nLiberal retorts concerned the chief issue cited by Maddow, Chuck Todd, Jen Psaki, Joy Reid, Nicole Wallace and other hosts: McDaniel\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s election subversion, including direct involvement in his attempt to nullify Biden\u2019s win in Michigan.\n\u201cRonna McDaniel\u2019s desperate attempt to whitewash her record as an election-denying Maga enabler was an insult to independent journalism and to any American who values the truth,\u201d Alex Floyd, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.\nSign up to Trump on Trial\nStay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials. Guardian staff will send weekly updates each Thursday \u2013 as well as bonus editions on major trial days.\nafter newsletter promotion\n\u201cFortunately, much like her and Donald Trump\u2019s conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, she failed. It\u2019s embarrassing that anyone would try to give McDaniel and her lies a soapbox after she spent years demonstrating such a blatant disregard for the truth, not to mention our entire democratic system. Proven liars who put loyalty to a political demagogue over our democracy have no place in politics \u2013 or in the media.\u201d\nMcDaniel did not comment. Politico reported that she was considering legal options and expected to be paid in full for her reported $600,000 two-year deal, which would in effect net her $500 a second for her Meet the Press interview.\nA \u201cperson close to McDaniel\u201d was quoted as saying: \u201cThe part that pisses me off most about this is not necessarily that [NBC executives] folded: it\u2019s [that] they allowed their talent to drag Ronna through the mud and make it seem like they were innocent bystanders.\u201d\nFor NBC executives, the pain may not be over. Though Semafor reported a senior Republican aide as saying \u201cNo one really cares about Ronna\u201d, her firing has handed her party a potent campaign issue.\nSemafor also reported anger among NBC staffers.\n\u201cPolitical reporters here didn\u2019t take part in the backlash, nor did they get to give input on the hire,\u201d an unnamed journalist was quoted as saying. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be the ones who have to pick up the pieces with sources dismayed with the organisation.\u201d\n This article was corrected on 27 March 2024.

        "published": " Transport correspondent",
        "content": "The longest hyperloop test track in Europe has opened, raising faint hopes once more that the maglev meets vacuum tube transport technology could be the future.\nOperators said the facility would help prove the hyperloop\u2019s feasibility, saying it could allow a 6,200-mile (10,000km) network of high-speed tubes to be in place around the continent by 2050.\nAs it stands, the European Hyperloop Center test bed in Veendam is not so much a loop as a 420-metre-long forked white pipe running alongside the railway and road that must still be used, for now, to transport people around this corner of the Netherlands.\nMade of 34 interconnected prefabricated 2.5-metre-wide steel cylinders, the partly EU-funded test pipe is somewhat shorter than the 2-mile track envisaged in 2020, and allows speeds of only a fraction of the 620mph (1000km/h) that proponents believe the technology can achieve.\nThe fork in the Vandeem pipe will allow engineers to test what happens at a \u201clane switch\u201d when a high-speed vehicle changes course. First tests will be carried out by the Dutch company Hardt Hyperloop in the coming weeks.\nThe centre\u2019s director, Sascha Lamme, said it was a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d, telling Agence France-Presse: \u201cYou need this to create a network. The lane switch is a diverging part of the infrastructure, so one part goes for example to Paris, the other one heads off to Berlin.\u201d\nSign up to TechScape\nAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe idea of the hyperloop was floated by Elon Musk in 2013, who proposed a line linking San Francisco and Los Angeles, using magnets to propel shuttles along pipes in near-vacuum conditions, with the lack of friction and air resistance potentially allowing the vehicles to rival the speed of aeroplanes.\nHis fellow tycoon Richard Branson continued to put the hype in hyperloop with a Virgin-branded company testing a passenger capsule in the Nevada desert in 2020. He sold up and the renamed Hyperloop One collapsed last year.\nWhile past predictions for the hyperloop have appeared unduly bold, Lamme maintained a pan-European network could appear in a few decades. \u201cIf you look at how highways were developed over time, it goes exponentially when the technology is ready. It should really be possible to get into a station in Amsterdam and travel to a city like Barcelona in two hours.\u201d\nSupporters say the hyperloop offers potentially cleaner and quieter as well as quicker transport, although passengers may balk at the idea of travelling in a windowless pod hurtling through an airless tube. Lamme suggested reluctance could be overcome with \u201ca capsule with a nice ceiling which might display stars or a nice sunny day\u201d.\nEurope\u2019s innovation may yet allow it to keep up with developments in China, which opened a one-mile test track for \u201clow-vacuum pipeline magnetic levitation technology\u201d in Shanxi province in 2022, according to state media."

        "headline": "How can Donald Trump\u2019s loss-making Truth Social be worth $9bn?",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 18.18 CET",
        "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s social network went public on Tuesday and quickly achieved a valuation of almost $8bn (\u00a36.3bn), a gain of more than 15% on its initial public offering (IPO) value. Shares rose again in volatile trading on Wednesday, rising 14% and valuing it at $9.6bn. That enormous success has raised questions, and not all of them are easy to answer.\nThe glib answer is \u201cbecause the most recent price someone bought a share of the company at is $66.46\u201d. The valuation of a publicly traded company such as Truth Social \u2013 officially, the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp, with the stock ticker DJT, referencing its founder\u2019s initials \u2013 is just a product of multiplying the value of an individual share with the number outstanding.\nTypically, that value, known as the market capitalisation, is kept in check by reference to the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of the company: how much money it makes or loses, and how fast it is growing or shrinking. But sometimes \u2026 it isn\u2019t.\nIn the case of Truth Social, its revenue during the first nine months of last year was just $3.3m from advertising, and it recorded a loss of $49m.\nHistorically, the big reason why stock valuations become detached from reality is speculative bubbles. Even if you don\u2019t think a company is particularly valuable, it may still be worth buying their stock at a high price if you think you can sell it on at an even higher price.\nBut Truth Social seems to be part of a more recent phenomenon: the \u201cmeme stock\u201d.\nThe term was coined to describe a small group of publicly traded stocks that have attracted a big proportion of private \u201cretail\u201d investors. Those investors typically use zero-commission trading apps such as Robinhood to take a much more active role in the markets than has been typical for individuals until recently, and coordinate on social media, particularly sites such as Reddit, to share stock tips.\nInfamously, the valuation of the American video game retailer GameStop rose by more than 1,800%, after a critical mass of investors coordinated on the WallStreetBets subreddit to take a stake. The investors\u2019 theory was that an engineered \u201cshort squeeze\u201d could force those who had \u201cshorted\u201d GameStop \u2013 that is, bet on its share price falling \u2013 to buy the shares back at inflated valuations. Three years on, GameStop remains almost 10 times more valuable than it was just before it achieved meme stock status \u2013 and just a quarter off its peak.\nInvestors in Donald Trump\u2019s social network definitely have a lot in common with those in the GameStop bubble. Coordinating online to boost a share\u2019s value with lots of little investments from individuals, rather than big corporate investors, is a similar story to GameStop and other meme stocks such as the cinema chain AMC or the rental company Hertz.\nBut unlike those shareholders, there is little sense that the Truth Social investors are driven by, or even care about, turning a profit on their stake. Instead, buying in is seen as a chance to invest in Trump \u2013 or even just to show your support for the man. In that way, Truth Social has less in common with other meme stocks and more with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies \u2013 a market the former president has also dabbled in.\nWith legal bills in the millions \u2013 including one reduced this week from $454m to a still hefty $175m \u2013 the big question for many is whether the Truth Social float will allow Trump to turn his newfound paper wealth into hard cash. Officially, the answer is a simple \u201cno\u201d: the IPO agreement requires insiders to hold their stake for six months after the company goes public.\nBut that can be overruled by a vote from the company\u2019s board of directors, which includes such independent votes as Donald Trump Jr, and Linda McMahon and Robert Lighthizer, two former officials in Trump\u2019s administration. Even if they choose not to authorise a sale, they may offer a halfway house, rewriting the agreement so that Trump Sr can use his shares as collateral for a loan.\nA few years ago, it was possible to foresee a rosy future for Truth Social. The increasing polarisation of American society meant the conditions were ripe for a rightwing social network, in contrast to the Silicon Valley ideology that dominated online. Truth Social, with its backing from Trump, felt like the most likely to succeed in that space, against the 4chan-inflected tone of its precursor Gab and the Trump-allied site Parler.\nThen Elon Musk bought Twitter. Under the billionaire\u2019s ownership, the site, rebranded as X, has become the home of the online right on its own, shedding a fifth of its users in the process. There\u2019s plenty of criticisms one can lay at the feet of Musk, but being censorious of rightwing viewpoints isn\u2019t one: one of his first acts upon taking control was to rescind Trump\u2019s ban from the platform \u2013 all for nothing, since the former president continued to post on Truth Social instead."

        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 17.05 CET",
        "content": "The final death toll from the Moscow concert hall terrorist attack could be much higher than the 140 confirmed dead, with Russian state investigations saying they have received 143 reports about people who were missing.\nThe investigative committee said in a statement that 84 bodies had so far been identified.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Baza, a Telegram channel with ties to Russia\u2019s security services, reported that 95 individuals not listed among the 120 names in the official registry of victims were unaccounted for after last week\u2019s shooting at the Crocus City Hall. Their relatives have been unable to establish contact with them since Friday\u2019s attack, Baza said.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the 84 bodies identified included those listed in the official registry.\nMany of the victims are believed to have died as a result of smoke inhalation after the attackers set the building on fire, which also caused the roof to collapse.\nIslamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attack, its deadliest on European soil and the deadliest by any group in Russia since the 2004 Beslan school siege.\nThe fire and the collapse of the roof made some of the victims\u2019 bodies unrecognisable, a source in Russia\u2019s emergency services told the 112 Telegram outlet. \u201cIn many cases, only fragments of the bodies remain,\u201d they added.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, some Russians attempted to track down missing relatives through social media.\n\u201cI beg you, please help me find any information. There are many of us, we are looking at all the lists and going to the hospitals,\u201d Luydmila Sitkikova, who was looking for her parents, wrote on the platform VK.\nOn Tuesday, senior Russian officials close to Vladimir Putin gave the clearest indication yet that Moscow was planning to pin the blame for the attack on Ukraine and the west, despite evidence that Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an Afghan offshoot of the terrorist group, was responsible.\n\u201cWe believe that the action was prepared by both the Islamist radicals themselves and was facilitated by western special services,\u201d Alexander Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), said. \u201cThe special services of Ukraine are directly related to this.\u201d He claimed that Kyiv had helped prepare the militants at an unidentified location in the Middle East.\nWhen asked by Russian reporters whether Ukraine and its allies, the US and Britain, were involved, Bortnikov said: \u201cWe think that\u2019s the case.\u201d\nHis words were echoed by Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the security council of Russia and a close ally of Putin, who told journalists that Ukraine was \u201cof course\u201d behind the attack.\nDespite blaming the west, Bortnikov admitted that the US earlier this month had passed on information to Russia about a possible terrorist attack being prepared in the country. \u201cThe information [relayed by the US] about the preparation of terrorist acts in places of mass gathering of citizens was of a general nature; we reacted to this information,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, the Belarusian president and Putin ally, Alexander Lukashenko, appeared to contradict the Russian leader\u2019s claim that the suspects were planning to cross to Ukraine where, Putin alleged, \u201cthe Ukrainian side\u201d had \u201cprepared a window\u201d for them before they were arrested.\nLukashenko said on Tuesday that the attackers had initially intended to enter Belarus rather than Ukraine, but were forced to divert to Ukraine after the Belarusian authorities had quickly set up checkpoints at the border. \u201cThat\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t enter Belarus. They saw that, so they turned away and went to the area of the Ukrainian-Russian border,\u201d he was quoted by the state news agency BelTA as saying.\nUkraine has denied it was involved in the attack. There is no evidence of Kyiv\u2019s or the west\u2019s involvement.\nOfficials in Kyiv have also ridiculed the claim that the attackers planned to flee into Ukraine, pointing to the fact that the border area was full of Russian military, including special forces. \u201cTo suggest the suspects were heading to Ukraine, would suggest they were stupid or suicidal,\u201d Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence directorate, told the BBC.\nRussian authorities have said the men were caught in the southern Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine and Belarus.\nThe official rhetoric about alleged Ukrainian and western involvement has been accompanied by a coordinated state media campaign.\nArgumenti i Fakti, a magazine owned by the government of Moscow, published a front-page story on Wednesday that read: \u201cWe know the architect of the Crocus terrorist attacks. And who organised it. May they burn in the hell. All this about Islamic State is rubbish.\u201d The article was accompanied by photographs of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak.\nThe west has lambasted Moscow for accusing it of involvement in the attack. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, on Tuesday wrote in a post on X: \u201cRussia\u2019s claims about the west and Ukraine on the Crocus City Hall attack are utter nonsense.\u201d"

I really do not think that people are going to run towards a repeat of that experience,\u201d he told a British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) event at Heathrow airport on Wednesday.\nLord Mandelson, speaking at the launch of the lobby group\u2019s report on building \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d after the general election, added that a Starmer government would build closer ties with the EU without rejoining.\nThe EU wanted a more \u201cstable, constructive relationship\u201d with the UK, Mandelson continued, but there was no desire in Brussels for wholesale negotiation of the country\u2019s return.\n\u201cReopen a negotiation? You\u2019ve got to be joking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [the EU] have got other priorities. They have other fish to fry now. And they\u2019re not going to go through the back-and-forth, up-and-down, seesaw motion; or another protracted, probably hard fought over, and indecisive negotiation with Britain. So that\u2019s simply answered.\u201d\nHis comments come after the BCC called for politicians to \u201cstep out of Brexit\u2019s long shadow\u201d and prioritise trade, including through closer ties with the UK\u2019s single largest trading partner.\nMartha Lane Fox, the tech entrepreneur and president of the BCC, said there was often a reluctance among politicians to either recognise problems or suggest solutions because of how they may be viewed either side of the Brexit divide.\n\u201cThis must stop. Our politicians must be bolder in their decision making. They must set out a strategy on how we manage EU regulation and, where it makes sense, to diverge so that British business can benefit,\u201d she said.\nMandelson said Brexit had triggered a \u201crollercoaster ride of instability, a merry-go-round of changing ministers\u201d that had left the British economy \u201ctravelling along with one arm behind our backs\u201d.\nSpeaking to business leaders in the headquarters of the company responsible for operating Heathrow, overlooking the airport\u2019s northern runway, the former business secretary under Tony Blair said Labour would not follow the Conservatives\u2019 post-Brexit strategy of chasing free trade deals around the world.\nHowever, he said there was a danger that Britain could become \u201cstranded\u201d between a possible Donald Trump administration in the US and weaker post-Brexit relationship with Brussels.\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\n\u201cThere is a danger that we become stranded, or that we become collateral damage in what could become quite an escalating tension,\u201d he said.\nTrump, who launched a series of increasingly bitter trade battles with the US\u2019s traditional allies and adversaries alike during his time in the White House, has said that if he is elected in November then he will impose 10% tariffs on all goods imported into the US.\nMandelson said the measure could push the UK to \u201cjoin with others to maximise the influence that we exercise\u201d including in the EU and other G7 nations, while also suggesting that action was required to strengthen the World Trade Organization.\n\u201cWhat a calamity [a trade war] would be, both for the US and Europe, and, I have to say, for the rest of the world,\u201d he said."

        "teaser": "Of all the threats to those suffering, one of the most frightening is that we tire \u2013 and their plight becomes background noise",
        "published": "Mon 25 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "Cast your mind back to early 2022, more than two years ago now. Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was such a shock, such a break with decades of political consensus, that it was treated as an act of aggression that could not for one moment be accepted or made peace with, only urgently rebuffed. Condemnations, lamentations and pledges of support, both for Ukraine\u2019s military effort and its displaced people, all signified the same thing \u2013 this was an aberration that would not be allowed to pass.\nBut pass it did. Russia has since suffered heavy losses and the war is referred to now as a \u201cquagmire\u201d for Putin, but pass it did. US arms support is dwindling, and a sizeable aid package has been stuck, blocked by partisan mischief, in the House of Representatives for months now. Just as striking is how the invasion has become relegated from high news and politics to another item jostling for attention, sympathy and outrage. An obscene banality of war is that if it goes on long enough, life will rearrange around it.\nNow imagine an act of aggression that had no such universal, full-throated condemnation, no pledges of large aid packages and no support or schemes for refugees. In fact, imagine one where the aid and military support is being provided, but it is to the party that is killing civilians and invading their territory. How much harder is it then, to maintain that sense of urgency and outrage? To keep it in the headlines? To keep the pressure up on politicians? To keep it even alive in your heart? It has been almost six months since Israel launched its assault in Gaza. But even as the images of dead children buried in rubble give way to those of dead children emaciated from hunger, there is an unmistakable sense of fade.\nSome of that fade is by design. Why would a matter that raises awkward questions for politicians be kept in the spotlight by those same politicians who have either supported Israel\u2019s actions or dragged their feet in condemning them. The result is not just avoidance, but dilution. The scale of the crisis in Gaza is not brought to us from the lecterns of the US president or his spokespeople, the sort of representatives who (still, jarringly) speak about Russian war crimes and how they must not be tolerated or normalised. On the first anniversary of the Ukraine invasion, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, addressed the United Nations security council and said: \u201cDay after day of Russia\u2019s atrocities, it\u2019s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage. But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal. Bucha is not normal. Mariupol is not normal. Irpin is not normal. Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.\u201d\nGaza is not normal, but you won\u2019t hear Blinken pleading that you not become desensitised to it. Instead it will come from human rights organisations, experts, reporters and aid workers who warn that what amounts to \u201cutter annihilation\u201d is not only exceptional, it is beyond description. But their collective efforts, admirable and credible as they are, catch in a bottleneck when they reach the powers that can do anything about them.\nSo the fact that the assault on Gaza has resulted in the \u201cbiggest cohort of paediatric amputees in history\u201d, or that if things remain as they are, Gaza will fall to \u201cthe most intense famine since the second world war\u201d, will not be acted upon by supporters and underwriters \u2013 both practical and moral \u2013 of Israel\u2019s offensive, beyond what are increasingly farcical requests that the Israeli government behave more reasonably. The volume at which such historic horrors are amplified is always artificially set to one that is much quieter than it should be \u2013 which at this point, is nothing short of at maximum.\nThat silencing also smothers and makes harder the work of those members of the general public who have, for months now, through protest and campaigning, tried to keep that volume as high as it can be; to simply state that this is not normal. But not only is their message being ignored, it is being actively suppressed through attempts to ban protest altogether, or imply relentlessly that it is about something else \u2013 anything else, rather than anger and worry about the fate of those in Gaza. An almost eerie outcome is that as hundreds of thousands pound the streets around the world on a weekly basis and tell their representatives how they feel, their voices are muted, or others speak for them; they become ventriloquist dummies for politicians who present them as parodies of threat and menace.\nThen there is just the fatigue. Fatigue from anger, from being given the run around by politicians, from exposure to events that no human can witness for an extended period of time without some sort of numbing, self-defence impulse kicking in. A double whammy burnout that comes from exposure to scenes and statements, casually posted by Israeli officials or sourced from their own cameras, of unarmed civilians being killed by drone missiles \u2013 but also the silence about them from official parties, even as the footage tears through WhatsApp messages and social media timelines. The problem when unheard-of things happen, is that once they do, they are then heard of.\nBut normalisation also comes from successfully presenting acts of man as acts of God. The more time passes and nothing is done about Gaza, the more it settles in the global conflict pool as something now just too complex (a \u201cquagmire\u201d if you will) to address. And in a way it is an act of nature, in the sense that the political alliances and historical legacies that made it possible are too hardwired to be undone without major disruption to decades-old political, military and racial settlements. How is fatigue not to set in, when one wakes up every day to battle with the geopolitical gods?\nThis is something perpetrators and abettors count on. That there will be a point \u2013 no matter how intense the scrutiny or distress \u2013 when things simply move on through sheer force of human nature, media cycles, and political introversion, especially as decisive elections loom. It feels like the moment when that wager pays off is nearing.\nBut the window of engagement and its global scale have already lasted longer than anyone expected, wrong-footing politicians and frustrating them in their efforts to manage public opinion. And with both a Rafah ground invasion and intense famine looming, the pressure on Israel and its supporters might continue to defy all the political bets.\n Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Margaret Sullivan",
        "teaser": "I worry about national security amid Trump\u2019s money ups and downs \u2013 they make way for influence-peddling and mischief",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 11.05 CET",
        "content": "Donald Trump has had an encouraging day or two on the money front.\nOn Monday, a New York appeals panel lowered \u2013 to a mere $175m \u2013 the amount the former president needs to cough up as he challenges the huge judgment against him in his civil fraud case. It\u2019s not clear whether Trump can obtain such a bond \u2013 he has another week or so to try. He couldn\u2019t raise an earlier, much higher sum, but this seems much more likely.\nThat means it\u2019s possible that he can avoid having liens put on his buildings (his \u201cbabies\u201d, as he called them). Welcome news in Trump World.\nThen, on Tuesday, his media startup had a wildly successful stock market debut as a public company. Since Trump owns 60% of Trump Media &amp; Technology (which owns Truth Social), his stake is now worth more than $5bn, the Washington Post reported.\nThat development gave him a big status boost: Bloomberg put him, for the first time, on to its list of the 500 richest people. Still, there\u2019s a hitch; he can\u2019t sell his shares for six months. So the windfall doesn\u2019t help with his immediate challenges.\nMeanwhile, Trump keeps singing the blues. He even indirectly compared his troubles to someone else with a large following, praising as \u201cbeautiful\u201d this message from a fan: \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that Christ walked through His greatest persecution the very week they are trying to steal your property from you.\u201d\nI don\u2019t feel concerned for Trump who, after all, is responsible for his thorny situation, despite his claims of victimhood.\nBut I do worry about America\u2019s national security amid Trump\u2019s financial ups and downs, because they make way for influence-peddling and mischief.\nOne reason is that major shareholders in Trump Media won\u2019t be forced to publicly and immediately disclose their stakes. That\u2019s potential trouble since we know that Trump\u2019s businesses got millions from foreign governments and officials while he was president.\nAs Noah Bookbinder, who heads the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told the Post, it\u2019s been obvious for years that he\u2019s open to such influence.\n\u201cThis seems like an opportunity that is tailor-made for that,\u201d Bookbinder said.\nIn other words, Trump is \u2013 as always \u2013 on the make. And his sheer heft of his legal and financial baggage makes that propensity much more dangerous.\nTrump\u2019s situation creates \u201can unprecedented opportunity to buy influence with a leading presidential candidate and a sitting president should he be re-elected\u201d, the non-profit organization wrote in an analysis last month.\nWithout suggesting any malfeasance, I\u2019ll note one example of overlapping interests: a Republican mega-donor, the billionaire Jeff Yass, was the biggest institutional shareholder of the shell company that merged with Trump\u2019s social media company, according to the New York Times.\nSign up to Follow Margaret Sullivan\nSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.\nafter newsletter promotion\nYass\u2019s firm is also a major investor in the parent company of TikTok; the House of Representatives just passed a bill that would force that Chinese parent company either to sell its popular video app or see it banned in the US.\nDespite Trump\u2019s reprieves in recent days, there\u2019s no end in sight for his financial or legal woes. And that\u2019s problematic, not just for him but for the nation.\nOne reason he is so desperate to be elected again is that he sees the presidency as a marvelous opportunity to line his pockets. Or \u2013 if absolutely necessary \u2013 to pay his debts, though that\u2019s never his first choice.\nMeanwhile, his chatter gets more unhinged every day.\nReferring to one all-caps rant that began with \u201cCROOKED POLS!!!\u201d and ended with \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d, his former rival Hillary Clinton posed a simple question: \u201cDoes this sound like a man who should have access to nuclear codes again?\u201d\nAs the former secretary of state knows all too well, the answer is clear.\nMargaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture"

        "content": "A friend recently asked me to help her look for a job. She wanted help writing a cover letter, a CV and an update on her LinkedIn profile. The first two tasks were easy, but the third? Not so much.\nIf, like me, you haven\u2019t been on LinkedIn for a while, it is \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 weird, now. What used to be a perfunctory, professional space sitting in stark contrast to the oversharing of other social media, LinkedIn is now full of 1,000-word polemics from unqualified people (\u201chere\u2019s really what makes people tick\u201d says a \u201cwizard of wellbeing\u201d), photos of holidays (\u201cwork hard, play hard!\u201d) and empty motivational platitudes (\u201cgive a man a fish and he\u2019ll eat for a day, teach a man to code and \u2026\u201d OK, sorry, I did just make that one up). It\u2019s all a bit cultish, and work is what is worshipped. Stepford Wives, employment edition.\nLinkedIn even has its own language now. Spend more than five minutes on it and you\u2019ll notice everyone parroting the same phrases. Seemingly everyone has a \u201cproven track record for delivering results\u201d and a \u201cbelief in integrated solutions\u201d (one of those buzz phrases that makes less sense the more you think about it. Doesn\u2019t everyone have a belief in integrated solutions? Or are there some people out there thinking: \u201cI personally hate joined-up thinking\u201d). Others have an emotive, possibly too-much-information story to share (\u201cI failed my exams at school, got married young, got divorced young, but now I work at Google and have a spicy girlfriend\u201d), and many want to \u201creach out\u201d \u2013 please, no touching in the workplace! \u2013 to discuss unnamed \u201copportunities\u201d.\nNow, you may be reading this thinking: \u201cWho cares? Let them have their space and stay off the platform if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d And ordinarily, I might agree. But then I watched my brilliant friend \u2013 my accomplished, talented friend \u2013 crumble in the face of it. Her journey has been non-linear: market stalls to magazines, counselling training and now HR. In my view, her work experience is diverse, rich and what makes her excellent at her job, but it doesn\u2019t fit neatly in the boxes of LinkedIn. It upset her to try to upload her life into this format \u2013 where dates had to be applied and money assigned (how do you get around the mandatory \u201cadd date\u201d for the experience of motherhood and informal childcare in your neighbourhood? Are you \u201cfreelancing\u201d if you organise community art events for nothing but a sense of civic pride?). She felt uncomfortable trading in grandiose statements of \u201cpersonal transformation\u201d, even though she has been on more of a journey than many users on the platform. But job vacancy adverts increasingly say \u201capply with your LinkedIn\u201d, and everyone in her field has joined the Stepford employees. I can see why she felt this is what she had to do \u2013 that employers would look for it, and she needed to be there; that if she didn\u2019t compete, she\u2019d be left behind.\nMuch has been written about how tech is changing how we see ourselves and each other. Instagram pushing unattainable beauty standards and lifestyles, Facebook fake news chipping away at people\u2019s belief in institutions, an X format that reduces a complex thought to 280 characters (no wonder nuance is impossible!), turning all of us into outrage addicts. Dating apps have commodified and gamified those most human phenomena: love and desire. Yet somehow LinkedIn has been left out of the spotlight. But here\u2019s my contention: I think it is doing something to us, shifting how we see our accomplishments, what we assign value to and what we don\u2019t. And perhaps most chilling of all, it promotes the idea that we are all just brands, and we must always \u2013 always \u2013 be selling. Apparently, LinkedIn is now being used as a full social network, a place where people talk about their marriages, make friends and maybe even date. What does that tell us about our lives outside work? Do we even still have lives outside work at all?\nPerhaps what is needed is a bit of real and refreshing honesty on LinkedIn. What could it look like, I wonder? I\u2019ll go first.\nHello, I am Coco. I have a proven track record of not responding to text messages in a timely manner. I am a strategic thought leader, in that I have thoughts and I sometimes let them lead me, but not always.

And now it\u2019s finally happened, 20 March). Nothing can prepare you for the loss of a parent. There is no roadmap for bereavement. Losing a parent means an enforced \u201cstepping up\u201d on the generational ladder \u2013 it\u2019s a step nearer to death. Perhaps more importantly, it\u2019s a step further away from childhood, now the all-protective figure has gone.

The platitudes abound \u2013 \u201ca long life, well lived\u201d \u2013 and comfort nobody. The sheer tedium of the administration, the registration, the organisation of a funeral, the contacting of old friends, can alleviate the initial shock, but it can also feel, as Adrian describes, like a repeated hammer blow of a horrible reality. Later, the disposal of effects feels intrusive, offensive, unnatural \u2013 clearing a house is like dismantling an entire\u00a0life;\u00a0intimations of mortality on a grand\u00a0scale.\nMore cliches, but some cliches are so true (that\u2019s why they were repeated): time does help; one step at a time; one day at a time. I wish the Chiles family the best of luck.Gill OthenKenilworth, Warwickshire\n I read Adrian Chiles\u2019s piece on his father with tears in my eyes. I am an only child and I too, as my own daughter does now, feared the day my parents were no longer here.\nMy dad died nearly six years ago after a very long illness and so my mum and I were left, and the grief for me was easier to bear because she was there, but then a cancer diagnosis came. Even though I knew our time was coming to an end, it never felt real. Even on the day when I knew \u201cthis is the day\u201d, it wasn\u2019t real. And so it was just the two of us as I prayed for her, listening to Foster and Allen while I held her hand and shared her last hours until she finally slipped away with peace and dignity.\nNo amount of preparation or even experience of death prepared me for the pain I\u2019ve felt since her death. Adrian, grief is a cruel thing. A painful reminder of love and loss. Take the ride as it comes.Jacqueline BeardsCoventry\n My dad just passed away as well, at 86. There is nothing that can prepare one for this. As I held his lifeless hands crossed on his chest, two versions of me wept. The man in his 50s and the child in me, losing his daddy.

        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.35 CET",
        "content": "Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy policy is even more sinister than the rightly critical article by Phineas Harper sets out (Councils now sell off more houses than they build. Thatcher\u2019s legacy, right to buy, is a failure, 26 March). Putting it bluntly, it was a brilliant way for the Conservatives to bribe a large sector of mainly Labour voters to switch.\nThe significant discounts offered made buying one\u2019s council house a huge bargain. What is more, in terms of housing provision, it did not benefit the sitting tenants as much as giving a substantial gift to their children, who often provided the initial capital knowing that they would inherit the house and make a big gain on its sale or on its subsequent letting for profit.\nIn cities like my own, with a large stock of council houses, their councils found that right to buy was mainly taken up by those in better areas and on the fringe of more problem estates, and they were left with properties to let in more difficult areas. One direct effect was to reduce greatly the opportunity for existing tenants to obtain transfers to better or more appropriate houses for their needs, and this produced much distress and bitterness among such\u00a0individuals.\nThe policy was a cynical and electorally successful way of abusing public funds for political ends.Michael MeadowcroftFormer Leeds city councillor\n I was brought up at the edge of Dogsthorpe, a large council estate in Peterborough built in the 1950s to house workers in the nearby engineering factories. Council housing had one huge advantage: it allowed local authorities to decide who lived where. Applicants were placed on priority lists based on size of family and need, and houses were allocated accordingly.\nThe right-to-buy scheme has meant that many of those houses are now in the hands of private landlords, and what local authority housing is left is insufficient and fragmented. Had council housing still been in existence, the private rental sector would have been smaller and less significant.\nCouncil housing allowed the state (local councils) more control over housing. That control has now largely gone, and the phrase \u201cclosing the stable door after the horse has bolted\u201d comes to mind.Toby WoodPeterborough\n Keir Starmer, in refusing to scrap right to buy in England, leaves himself the option to extend it to tenants of private landlords. The houses would be sold at a discount, taking into account the original purchase price and improvements. This would lower both private rents and the prices of starter homes.Dr Orest MulkaSnarestone, Leicestershire\n Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "author": "Jonathan Freedland",
        "teaser": "The greater the wait until the election, the more reassurance Labour must provide. And that weakens its future mandate ",
        "published": "Fri 15 Mar 2024 17.43 CET",
        "content": "We\u2019re at the fag-end of this government, but it\u2019s going to burn for a while longer yet. Those who hoped it might finally be stubbed out of its misery on 2 May were set straight by Rishi Sunak on Thursday, when he killed off speculation that he might add to the clutch of local elections scheduled for that day by calling a general one. The long wait for this government to be flattened under the voters\u2019 collective shoe goes on.\nWe\u2019ve lived through fag-end administrations before, but this one is more toxic. Back in the dog days of the John Major era, it was bonking backbenchers and brown-envelope cash for questions that pointed to the political terminus. This time, the rot is graver.\nWe have a prime minister who took more than 24 hours to concede that comments made by the party\u2019s biggest donor \u2013 suggesting Diane Abbott be \u201cshot\u201d, and that the Hackney North MP made you \u201cwant to hate all black women\u201d \u2013 were, in fact, racist. Until then, it seems, Downing Street accepted the health tech magnate Frank Hester\u2019s insistence that citing Abbott when speaking about hating people who are female and black \u201chad nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin\u201d. Still, the belated admission has come with no promise to return the \u00a310m Hester is confirmed to have given, nor the reported additional donation of \u00a35m. The Tory position seems to be: guilty of making racist remarks he might be, but Hester\u2019s money is good and we\u2019re clinging to it.\nWhat secret trysts and Paris Ritz hotel bills were to the Major years, race and racism are to the last days of Sunak. On Thursday, Michael Gove unveiled a new definition of extremism, by which he hopes to target neo-Nazi groups and organisations with what he called \u201cIslamist orientation and beliefs\u201d. His move comes just as the Tory right has spotted a culture war opportunity in exploiting anti-Muslim sentiment, casting Labour as either too weak in the face of, or even in thrall to, Islamist extremism. Lee Anderson\u2019s defection to Reform, after he said the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamist \u201cmates\u201d, has led some Conservatives to conclude there is a risk of being overtaken on the Islamophobic right \u2013 and that that is a constituency that needs to be fed.\nIn this climate, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the government is moving to offer people denied asylum up to \u00a33,000 to \u201cencourage\u201d them to move to Rwanda, a scheme that, to quote the Labour peer Stewart Wood, suggests \u201ca government that is so determined to nail the people traffickers that it has decided to subsidise them\u201d. The same elements recur: a governing party whose time is running out and that has concluded, in its desperation, that the last seam of votes to be mined is among those who demand an ever harsher face be turned toward refugees and minorities.\nThe longer this goes on, the worse it is for the country. While governments in their death throes might not be able to do much good \u2013 announcing long-term plans they will never implement \u2013 they can do much harm.\nBut this period is also bad for Labour. Roy Jenkins\u2019 Yoda-like advice to the young Obi Wan-KenoBlair in the mid-1990s has now become weary through overuse, but it remains true: an opposition leader with a hefty poll lead is like a man carrying a priceless Ming vase across a polished floor. That task is already hard and Keir Starmer has been at it for at least 18 months, since Tory support cratered after the Partygate revelations, the ousting of Boris Johnson and the debacle of Liz Truss. By ruling out 2 May, Sunak has made that walk across the shiny floor that much longer.\nIt\u2019s messing with Labour heads. They have three or four different versions of \u201cthe grid\u201d, where they schedule key policy announcements and the like, one for each potential election date. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-mushing,\u201d says one close Starmer adviser.\nBut the problems are more substantial than mere timetabling. For one thing, the longer this goes on, the more time the Conservatives have to steal what might have otherwise been defining campaign pledges for Labour. Labour cherished its extension of the windfall tax on the fossil fuel companies and had made its tax on non-doms totemic. In his budget last week, Jeremy Hunt nicked both.\nWorse, the long goodbye to the Tories requires Labour to maintain the posture it has to adopt before every election \u2013 constant reassurance on those areas the party defines as its \u201ccore brand weaknesses\u201d, namely the economy, national security and, more recently added, borders and immigration \u2013 for so long, the muscles start to ache.\nIn its quest to prove fiscal prudence, Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have already announced the halving of what had been billed as Labour\u2019s big idea: an annual \u00a328bn of green investment. The trouble is, the longer the election isn\u2019t called, the more reassurance Reeves has to provide. Witness her response to that act of political larceny by Hunt. Reeves said that she would find the \u00a32bn she had planned to take off non-doms to spend on the NHS and school breakfast clubs \u2013 and which Hunt diverted instead to a cut in national insurance \u2013 by cutting other spending. She couldn\u2019t oppose Hunt\u2019s NI cut; nor could she propose another tax in its place. The god of pre-election fiscal rectitude, devotion to which was forged by the experience of serial Labour defeat, demanded she shrink her spending plans instead.\nAnd it can push even a trained, experienced economist such as Reeves to hint, as she did this month, at the old Thatcherite catechism that managing the public finances is like balancing the books in a household budget \u2013 a notion that enrages Keynesian social democrats who know that sometimes it makes sense for governments, unlike families, to spend their way out of a crisis.\nThe result is that Starmer and Reeves spend a lot of time telling voters what they won\u2019t be able to do rather than what they will, the latter just last weekend explaining that a Labour government would not be able to \u201cturn things around straight away\u201d. I truly understand this need for reassurance, but it does come at a cost. Voters know the country is in desperate need of investment, massively and urgently. They know there is so much that doesn\u2019t work or is cracking under the strain, whether its GP surgeries or the courts, mental health services or the transport system. When they hear Labour talk so cautiously when the situation is so severe, they either end up hoping that the party is lying just to get through till polling day \u2013 and that, once in office, they might do a Joe Biden and spend much more than they promised \u2013 or they give up hoping altogether.\nIt\u2019s true that for Labour to win an election, it\u2019s more important to generate trust among doubters than enthusiasm among supporters. I see that. But, if Labour does win, it will also need a mandate to act. If it keeps paring back an already modest offer in the name of reassurance, eventually there will be nothing left. It desperately needs this fag-end period to end. Election day cannot come soon enough \u2013 for Labour\u2019s sake and the country\u2019s.\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

An investigation I conducted into a suicide in the community revealed very poor practice, with two staff falsifying records to cover up their failure to visit a suicidal service user.\nI recommended disciplinary investigations, but my report was not welcomed by senior managers, who \u2013 running scared of a famously rigorous coroner \u2013 considered it \u201ctoo blame-y\u201d. I was pressured to change my report. I declined to do so, supported by my own manager. But it was drastically watered down by senior managers. There was no comeback for the staff in question, and one was promoted soon after.\nIt is saddening to learn that this approach appears to be endemic. With such a culture, not only are service users and those close to them denied honest accounts of service failures, but there can be no opportunities for change, despite the mouthing of platitudes about transparency and accountability and \u201clearning from mistakes\u201d.Name and address supplied"

        "content": "I\u2019m a politically disenchanted member of gen\u00a0Z who is dragging herself to the polls with little hope that any politician can significantly raise my spirits after 14 years of Tory horror. But little hope is still hope. When I read Owen Jones\u2019s article my heart sank, and I fear facing another five years staring into the austere blue abyss (The Labour party is in my blood. Here\u2019s why I\u2019ve just cancelled my membership, 21 March). Is Jones really helping? He\u2019s made it clear in his article and video that voting for what feels like our only option to end Tory rule is a terrible idea. Despite his optimistic attempt to promote vague alternatives to Labour, I feel more cynical.\nIn every election I have voted in, the Conservatives have always won. They\u2019re good at winning. The first time I think my Labour vote could be used to oust them, Jones tries to convince us not to bother.\nUp against millions more pounds in campaign funding, and constituency boundary changes, I\u2019m not confident Labour has this one in the bag. Though the Greens care deeply about our planet\u2019s future survival and some independents are seeking power for the people, splitting the left-leaning vote is not practical. Starmer-branded boring practicality is the best hope we have against a populist government rushing to the extreme right. Clarice Francis London\n Owen Jones recommends that people who think that Labour has somehow betrayed them should support the Greens or independents at the next election. While voting for one of these candidates might well assuage his own personal moral outrage at Labour\u2019s supposed failings, these groups are never likely to form a government, but could well damage Keir Starmer\u2019s chance of securing a parliamentary majority. So, the questions is: would he, and those who think like him, prefer to have another five years of the Tory party smashing up what\u2019s\u00a0left of the welfare state?Richard EllisStoke-on-Trent\n Owen Jones\u2019s article strikes a resonant chord. What is the point of being in government if the Labour party does nothing in office to move forward the lot of the less privileged members of society? Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies may have failed to sway the electorate, but they did show positive and progressive intent and a direction of travel that appealed to a great many.\nI\u2019ve just returned from an evening at the National Theatre celebrating the achievement of Aneurin Bevan, the leading architect and inspiration for the NHS. While celebrating its foundation, the play also eloquently makes the case for nursing the NHS back to health. The Labour party must show real leadership and devise policies that truly inspire. Philip Huggett London\n Like Owen Jones, I too am dismayed by the dismantling of Labour party values and beliefs. Now 74 years old, I too was a lifelong supporter and member of the party, a working-class girl raised by a single mother who believed, as I do, in shared support and care in society. I have two of her paintings of the Jarrow March on the wall of my home. I have been called many things, from \u201cmisguided\u201d to \u201cdangerous\u201d, because of my views.\nI resigned my membership of the party when it became clear after the EU referendum that they would never raise the flag of opposition and change.

        "content": "Kensington Palace, which remains in its private quarters the London residence of Prince William and Kate (for ever to be known as) Middleton, currently has an exhibition in its public rooms of \u201cUntold Lives\u201d, a medley of royal servants. If any of the tourists walking round on Thursday felt the piquancy of treading so close to a home Kate Middleton may or may not be in (for the first time since her marriage, probably, nobody can say for sure where she is), that didn\u2019t show on their politely interested faces.\nThe opening portrait is of Bridget Holmes: 96 years old, carrying a mop in comedic representation of her role as a \u201cnecessary woman\u201d to monarchs all the way from Charles I to William III. Taking into account the different conception of childhood in the 1590s, when she was born, we can reasonably assume Holmes spent about 90 continuous years shovelling shit, her life remaining untold so that the story of kings could be told.\nThat\u2019s the deal with the monarchy; inequality needs two halves \u2013 a large number of lives debased and made menial to enable some shiny ones at the top. It would have made perfect sense when kings, having divine right, were a bridge between men and God, and a reasonable amount of sense in an age of greater deference, but these days it only makes sense if the spectacle of enormous wealth is itself somehow nourishing to the national psyche.\nIf William and Kate represent some fantasy life, that we can enjoy remotely as a fairytale, projecting ourselves into it, then \u2013 here\u2019s a cute paradox \u2013 the more that costs, the more it\u2019s worth it. It never did it for me, but what do I know? The Prince and Princess of Wales only have one job in this contract, which is to enjoy perfect lives. People always go on about how hard the royals work, and I\u2019ve never really bought it \u2013 how hard can it be, going places, shaking hands, being polite, going home? But if the real job is to embody a life in which wealth, being magic, has erased every care, then I can see that would be awesomely hard work.\nJust how much damage this family has inflicted on itself since Kate was last seen in public on Christmas Day will be impossible to determine until the mystery has lifted. Certainly, they\u2019ve breached their contract with the world\u2019s media. When news agencies had to pull the Mother\u2019s Day photo of the princess and her three children, believing it to have been doctored, this holed them beneath the waterline, trust wise, and it\u2019s hard to see how they could now recover. Phil Chetwynd, global news director of Agence France-Presse, described neutrally on BBC Radio 4 that the Firm had moved into the same credibility bucket as North Korea, which seems harsh \u2013 almost nobody, except everyone on the internet, thinks Kate Middleton has been shot in the head \u2013 but fair. Trust is pretty binary: you either have it or you don\u2019t.\nThe relationship between the British press and the royals has been vexed for ages, observably since Meghxit but arguably since Diana. The deal was supposed to be this: the tabloid press would write fawningly about the core team, choose one or two hate figures whose privacy would be traduced and inner life relentlessly speculated upon, and the Firm would enable all that with tactical intel drops and the turning of a blind eye.\nIt really did seem in 1997 as though that equilibrium had been destroyed. In the aftermath of Diana\u2019s death, the red tops talked about a \u201cvast outpouring of grief\u201d, and that was real, but they omitted to mention the rage people felt towards the newspapers that had hounded her. The palace, though, sought no vengeance. Only Harry admitted even holding a grudge, and things were back to normal pretty soon. Harry and Meghan\u2019s various cases against the press were a mixed bag \u2013 some won, some dropped. What they didn\u2019t achieve was any significant realignment of the media/monarchy protocols. In the end, it\u2019s Harry living in the US, trying to make sense of a life he wasn\u2019t born to rule, not the Daily Mail.\nWith the British public, though, the royals\u2019 contract is completely different. A small but growing number of us wish they would simply desist, become normal, stop costing so much. A sizeable middle doesn\u2019t care one way or the other, and those who do watch these lives with fascinated admiration need them to be perfect. We can talk loftily about William and Kate\u2019s missteps \u2013 how could they have been so stupid as to Photoshop an image, and so amateurishly? Don\u2019t they know the first rule of lying, in public life, which is: stop doing it and tell the truth? But they haven\u2019t been stupid at all, they\u2019ve behaved exactly as humans do, trapped in a deal they can\u2019t uphold. They cannot lead the perfect, trouble-free lives that they have to lead in order to make sense.\nThe rumours and theories about what\u2019s happened to Kate Middleton are so varied and lurid now that whatever the truth is, I anticipate its landing as a bit of an anticlimax, which will hasten the return of normality. So maybe they\u2019ve actually played a blinder, and with their secrecy and cack-handedness generated a drama against which the truth will look like no big deal. But I don\u2019t think this was deliberate. I think their lives are, ironically, a bit like a fairytale, but one of the dark ones, where a troll (or a nation of trolls) holds them hostage to an impossible demand.\nZoe Williams is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.35 CET",
        "content": "Nick Bano makes a compelling argument that discussions about increasing the housing supply are misguided if their aim is to fix the UK housing crisis (The end of landlords: the surprisingly simple solution to the UK housing crisis, 19 March). His\u00a0data and succinct description of\u00a0the historical context are consistent with qualitative and quantitative evidence provided by\u00a0various UK housing scholars.\nAs part of my work as a computational economist, I try to understand the connections between housing wealth inequality and the set of incentives that are shaped by institutions such as the market and the government, ie \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d. For this purpose, I develop artificial intelligence models consisting of a computational representation of every household and property in the economy (with their most relevant characteristics and behaviours), and the rules of the game that incentivise them to engage in interactions such as purchasing and renting real estate.\nThese \u201cdigital twins\u201d of the UK housing market generate data that are consistent with official statistics, so one can simulate detailed policy interventions that, in the real world, would be impossible to test under constrained time and financial\u00a0resources.\nBano\u2019s arguments resonate with a study where I find that increasing the housing stock would be a poor choice of intervention if the policy target was reducing housing wealth inequality. However, and contrasting with Bano\u2019s view on a simple solution, my research suggests that housing policy interventions would need to be rather nuanced, well-timed and carefully coordinated, for example, by considering regional differences, target populations, financial incentives, income sources, and how taxes are instrumented. Many of these factors are indeed addressed by commentators, policymakers and academics, but\u00a0in a scattered manner.\nPerhaps it is time to bring these different perspectives together through the analytic prowess of AI methods to scrutinise policy proposals and formulate holistic solutions to one of the most pressing and complex socioeconomic issues in Britain.Dr Omar A GuerreroHead of computational social\u00a0science research, The Alan Turing Institute\n The collapse of landlordism is indeed a noble aim whose achievement would remove one of the biggest factors in social deprivation and inequality in the UK. But as a former tenant who has just been evicted under section 21, the so-called no-fault eviction law, I believe we need to recognise the bigger picture, the wider vested interests in maintaining the system of injustice and exploitation that underpins our housing crisis.\nMy wife and I are pensioners evicted for daring to ask our landlord to fix damp, mould and rain coming into our home.\nWe had plenty of things to say in court to defend ourselves against eviction, not just the landlord\u2019s criminal negligence in failing to maintain the property in a safe, habitable state, but the debt collection agency thug hired by the landlord\u2019s insurance company to terrorise us in our home to make us leave. We have never been in rent arrears by so much as a penny. We were not allowed to mention a word of this in court and were duly\u00a0forced into expensive temporary accommodation by the arrival of the bailiffs.\nThere is a vast empire of dishonest and unscrupulous operators helping to drive up homelessness and trap millions in miserable, unsafe housing. It includes landlords in parliament supporting blatantly unfair laws, big legal and insurance firms, unprincipled lawyers and the courts. The landlords are just the\u00a0tip of the\u00a0iceberg.Name and address supplied\n I was delighted to see that someone is finally talking about the elephant in the room in regard to our housing crisis, and that it has a name: landlordism. Far too much political energy has been wasted discussing damaging and dead-end housing policies like building all over the green belt, pushing up prices with \u201chelp to buy\u201d, or punishing council housing tenants with spare bedrooms.\nMy own family lived in several private rented sector properties in an expensive area for 15 years before we were finally offered (also very expensive) social housing. Based on an average rent of around \u00a31,100 per month over that period, we lined the pockets of our landlords to the tune of almost \u00a3200,000 \u2013 money earned through our own hard work and that of the taxpayers who fund housing benefit.\nSurely the answer is to create straighforward disincentives to owning property simply in order to make easy money from other people\u2019s effort. How hard is it to pass a law abolishing six-month contracts and no-fault evictions? How about taxing the passive wealth earned by landlords? Why is it taboo to discuss rent controls? It might be enough to make them sell up and earn an honest living.Daniel CarterCambridge\n I am what you might call a good landlord, reasonable and caring and not what I would term greedy. There are many like me. I keep my houses in good order and look after my tenants. There is a fair amount of social housing in an appalling condition, so how can the solution be to take all rented housing into the state and charitable sector?\nWould it not be better to root out all examples of unsafe and unhealthy housing in whichever sector, rather than penalise one over the other? Fair rents, yes.

        "content": "There are many good reasons for Rishi Sunak to postpone a general election. All are about reducing his party\u2019s potential loss of seats. There is also an overwhelming reason for calling one now. It is in the national interest.\nBritish government needs an act of cleansing. It needs renewal and a fresh start under a new regime. Every month that start is delayed has a cost in decisions postponed. The presumed next government of Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is waiting and ready to go. Its learning curve will be steep and its climb hard. There is not the remotest national advantage in another six months of bickering and squabbling.\nAffliction descends weekly on Sunak\u2019s head. He has shown himself to be an honest and articulate prime minister during probably the toughest episode in modern British politics. But his party and his government machine have failed him. The Rwanda bill, questionable donors, bankrupt councils, tax cuts, extremism laws and defence spending tumble out of Downing Street in a chaotic shambles.\nNow he must confront an alleged plot to replace him with Penny Mordaunt, the apparent favourite of Tory moderates, who several MPs claim has been \u201con manoeuvres\u201d for several months. While Mordaunt herself has not commented publicly, her supporters have called the claims \u201cbonkers\u201d \u2013 and such a bid would indeed be destabilising, just when Sunak most needs support.\nMordaunt is currently leader of the House of Commons. She heads the central oligarchy of power in Britain, the party of government in parliament. Of all cabinet members, her duty is one of absolute loyalty to her leader. Yet she and others remain silent as Sunak trips and stumbles from one calamity to another. Parliamentary lobby journalists gaily disseminate challenges to his leadership. His enemies mostly remain anonymous and, for all we know, may not exist, while his named supporters make the most obvious remark: that a fourth leadership contest in five years would indicate a party unfit for a minute longer in government.\nThroughout Conservative history, the party\u2019s unity has been cited as its secret weapon, manifest as loyalty to the leader of the day. There have been two occasions postwar when it has been as hard-pressed as now. One was in 1964 under Alec Douglas-Home and the other in 1997 under John Major. In both cases, the leader was challenged, respectively by Enoch Powell and by the anti-EU \u201cbastards\u201d. But come election time, loyalty held. The party went dignified into opposition and leadership hopefuls bided their time.\nThere is no dignity now. Mordaunt is a modern politician who, like Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, can fill a room and please a crowd. She did not seem to merit cabinet promotion, other than briefly, over the past troublesome years, as defence secretary for 85 days. She is of the populist rather than executive stream of British politician.\nThis could be a strength, if she were ever to make a leadership bid, but Tory leaders including Margaret Thatcher have been careful to surround themselves with a tight cabal of ministerial talent. It was Johnson\u2019s mass expulsion of such talent in 2019 \u2013 fearing for his position \u2013 that has left the party so denuded of leadership ability today. The deplorable state of the cabinet machine during the pandemic is the one message of the otherwise useless Covid inquiry.\nAs the political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville declared, every political party in Britain is essentially a club. Its ability to act in unison is its greatest strength. That is why Britain has always found it impossible to devolve real power to national or local governments. But the club demands its members obey the rules. One of the great strengths of the historical Labour party was to adapt the discipline of the trade union to parliament.\nThe Tories have suffered factional splits in recent decades, variously into the Referendum, Brexit, UK Independence and Reform parties. The Conservative party has survived them all, admittedly with help from the first-past-the-post system. The present challenge from Reform looks superficially serious, though its former leader, Nigel Farage, is carefully biding his time. Who knows \u2013 but his future may yet be with the Tories.\nThe clear possibility hovers on the horizon of a Farage-Johnson-Mordaunt \u201cred wall\u201d coalition. It could relaunch a \u201cNew Tory\u201d party \u2013 on the model of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour \u2013 amid the putative ruins of a Starmer government. What is different today is the lack of any critical mass of respectable Toryism to offer it resistance. At the prospect of such a future we can only tremble.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

        "teaser": "There\u2019s an urgent need for a fairer electoral system \u2013 and if politicians won\u2019t make it happen, the people will",
        "published": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "This is what democracy looks like: hundreds of people queueing in the rain, seeking to take back control of a political system that treats voters like an afterthought. Last weekend, a remarkable democratic experiment reached its first conclusion. A process that began here in South Devon and is now spreading to other constituencies has allowed voters to reclaim the initiative from centralised and self-interested political parties. It directly confronts our unfair electoral system.\nOurs is one of many constituencies in the UK known as \u201cprogressive tragedies\u201d: places in which most people vote for parties to the left of the Tories but which, thanks to our iniquitous first-past-the-post system, end up with Tory representatives. The Conservatives have ruled here since 1924, often without majority support.\nThe Labour and Conservative leaderships conspire to sustain this system, in the hope of absolute majorities. But it works, like other such truncations of democracy (think of our political funding arrangements) much better for the Conservatives than it does for Labour. As Neal Lawson of the democracy campaign Compass argues, of the 11 general elections since 1979, \u201ceight were won by the Conservative party and only three by Labour. But cooperation among progressive parties could have averted all eight Conservative majority governments bar 2015.\u201d\nBoth within the Labour party and in the country at large, there\u2019s an urgent desire for a fairer system. Unfortunately, this desire is thwarted by the Labour leadership. The result? As Lawson points out, of the 15 wealthy nations surveyed by the ParlGov project, voters in the UK are the most left-leaning, yet suffer the most rightwing governments. Sometimes it seems that Labour strategists would rather possess control than power.\nThis is not going to change in the near future. All pleas to work for the greater good, even when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, have been met with stony refusal. As someone well-placed in the party told me, our undemocratic system, and the prospect it offers of gaining an absolute majority, \u201cis like the ring in Lord of the Rings. You know it harms you, but once it\u2019s within your grasp, you can\u2019t give it up.\u201d\nThe simple and brilliant idea of a group of people in the South Devon constituency was to take these decisions out of the hands of the parties and return them to the people. The UK\u2019s first \u201cpeople\u2019s primary\u201d involved seven meetings held around the constituency. Candidates for progressive or vaguely progressive parties were invited to explain to voters why they would be best placed to evict the Conservative. After each meeting, constituents voted by secret ballot to choose their champion. When the aggregate result was announced, everyone in the constituency could see who other people believed was the most promising challenger.\nWithout this help, we have to guess other people\u2019s voting intentions, and we often guess wrong. The people\u2019s primary overcomes the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, ensuring we are less likely to waste our vote. The decision the constituents make doesn\u2019t prevent the other parties from standing. But, by selecting a common champion, it reduces the chances of letting the Tory back in.\nLabour, thrown into chaos by the leadership\u2019s attempt to control their choice of candidates, has yet to field a contender, so was unable to participate. The party leadership would have blocked its involvement anyway. Their loss. The Liberal Democrat and Green candidates battled gamely across two weeks of meetings. The Lib Dem, Caroline Voaden, won decisively. So now we know that our best chance of helping to eject the dismal Tory MP is to vote for her.\nI chaired the first of these meetings. Tickets sold out two days after they were issued. The questions were searching and pertinent. Whatever the results at the general election, this is already a victory of sorts: bringing people back into the political process, showing how democracy could become a living proposition, rather than a dry and curling parchment locked behind a portcullis with chains.\nNow the process has begun in five other constituencies, including those represented by Kemi Badenoch and Danny Kruger. The South Devon pioneers have identified 57 progressive tragedies in which the Conservatives are still predicted to win and there is some uncertainty about who the most effective challenger is likely to be. They\u2019ve offered to share their model with these constituencies, but not with those where one progressive contender is clearly ahead of the others. In those cases they recommend a different system: stopthetories.vote.\nAll the big political parties hate these primaries. The Tory response is understandable: they know they can\u2019t survive a fair democratic process in a progressive constituency. Most shocking and self-destructive has been the reaction of Liberal Democrat party managers. After the South Devon process had begun, a letter to candidates from the Lib Dem chair in England instructed them: \u201cUnder no circumstances are you to take part \u2026 any candidate who ignores this instruction, and participates in a primary, risks having their approved status rescinded and the withdrawal of party support and resources.\u201d\nThe letter revealed an almost comical misunderstanding of what the primary process is and how it is conducted. It claimed that the primary could put candidates in breach of election law on both process and expenses. In reality, the process has been closely scrutinised by the Electoral Commission, and applies a long list of safeguarding rules. The spending (which is very small, as the primaries are created and run by volunteers) takes place before the champion is chosen, so, as the Electoral Commission has confirmed, doesn\u2019t eat into the candidates\u2019 capped election budgets. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by such reactions: any process involving a transfer of control, however beneficial, will be fiercely opposed by those who are losing it.\nOut of adversity comes better tactics. The Isle of Wight East constituency, after the refusal of both Labour and the Lib Dems to play, is designing a new process that doesn\u2019t rely on their involvement.\nThe primaries won\u2019t deliver a perfect system. We\u2019ll still be stuck with a centralised and coercive politics, unmatched to the needs of the complex system we call society, based on the illegitimate concepts of presumed consent and remote decision-making. We will properly reclaim that power only when our representative politics are accompanied by participatory and deliberative decision-making.\nBut it\u2019s a start: a small, slow revolution in a country whose people have long been deprived of their democratic rights.

        "headline": "Birmingham\u2019s cuts reveal the ugly truth about Britain in 2024: the state is abandoning its people",
        "author": "John Harris",
        "teaser": "First it was austerity. Now it\u2019s something even worse: the suggestion that people didn\u2019t need vital local services to begin with",
        "published": "Sun 17 Mar 2024 14.40 CET",
        "content": "Four years ago, I saw something on a computer screen that I have never forgotten. The UK was six weeks into lockdown, and I was working on a series of Guardian videos based on raw footage from around the country, most of which had been filmed on people\u2019s phones.\nWe had made contact with a community activist from Alum Rock in central Birmingham \u2013 and he had captured an unbearably vivid signifier of what people there were faced with. First, he showed us a car park outside a mosque, where six or seven rectangular white tents had been put up. Then, he pulled back the flap that formed one of their front doors to reveal a sight that left him silent: stacks of coffins, each awaiting a janazah, the Muslim funeral.\nIn June 2020, Birmingham was identified as the UK\u2019s \u201ccoronavirus capital\u201d: the first local authority area in the UK to register more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19. Just under a year later, I went there to report on the pandemic\u2019s aftershocks \u2013 among them, a 15% rate of unemployment and the sudden closure of the palatial John Lewis store opened only five years before. Talking to people, I got a sense of both lingering trauma and an amazing drive to somehow keep going; in 2022, that same indefatigable spirit was displayed to the wider world when the city consummately hosted the Commonwealth Games. But then came yet another huge blow.\nMost of us now know the basics. In 2023, Birmingham city council \u2013 which is controlled by Labour, and is reckoned to be Europe\u2019s largest local authority \u2013 effectively went bankrupt. There were three key reasons: massive cuts in funding from Whitehall, the cost of the belated resolution of the council\u2019s gender pay gap, and the mind-boggling mishandling of a new IT system. In the midst of the rising need for council services \u2013 much of which was rooted in all the dislocation and disaster of the Covid crisis \u2013 all this spelled disaster. Now, many of the city\u2019s services must be either hacked down or done away with, in pursuit of savings of about \u00a3300m over two years. As far as anyone understands it, this is the deepest programme of local cuts ever put through by a UK council.\nAll of this has been widely covered in the national media, but what has not quite come through are the visceral injustices that sit at the story\u2019s centre. Payback for the failings of politicians and bureaucrats is falling most severely on children, whose provision will be cut by \u00a352m in 2024-25 and \u00a363m in 2025-26. Among other savings, the council is ending its annual \u00a38.4m contribution to an \u201cearly help\u201d service that provides families in crisis with everything from emergency financial assistance to advice on breastfeeding, and thereby threatening its survival. For kids aged over 16 who have special educational needs, there will be no more taxis or minibuses to schools and colleges: as part of a quest to claw back about \u00a37m a year from transport costs, they are being offered such grim consolations as \u201cpersonal travel budgets\u201d and something called \u201cindependent travel training\u201d.\nWhat is happening to other areas of spending is almost as shocking. A \u00a34.8m youth services budget is being cut by almost half. The council\u2019s spend on the arts will now be zero. Eleven community centres are being sold off. On and on it all goes, through highway maintenance, street lighting, recycling, bin collection and street cleaning. The twisted punchline is an increase to council tax of 21% by 2026, which will surely be received by people as a stark example of the modern British malaise: that everyday sense of endlessly paying more, but getting less and less.\nBirmingham may be an outlier, but comparable stories are playing out all over England: in Nottingham, Somerset, Hampshire, Leicester, Bradford, Southampton and more. The House of Commons levelling up, housing and communities select committee puts English councils\u2019 current financial gap at about \u00a34bn a year, which could have been filled more than twice over by the money Jeremy Hunt used for that almost meaningless cut in national insurance. He seems to still think that councils must sink or swim: even more depressingly, he and his allies in the rightwing press have reprised old and stupid rhetoric about millions supposedly being wasted on \u201cconsultants\u201d and \u201cdiversity schemes\u201d.\nAnd Labour? Last weekend, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was repeatedly asked by the Sky News presenter Trevor Phillips if she would fix councils\u2019 crises once Labour was in power. But she would only offer her usual words about the awful problems she would inherit, and vague claims that changes to the planning system and increased business investment may eventually feed through to money for local services. I admire the optimism of people who think she is secretly preparing some kind of national rescue package, but I cannot quite shake off that eternally insightful Maya Angelou quotation: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d\nContinuing austerity does not just kill people\u2019s services; it has long since warped most political debates about what we should expect from the state. In lots of places, squalor, mess and festering social problems are now seen as the norm. So too is a scepticism about people\u2019s need for help, which is endlessly encouraged by politicians and people in the media. That absurd opportunist Lee Anderson made his name by claiming that food banks were \u201cabused\u201d by people who didn\u2019t need them. Now, the Times columnist Matthew Parris claims to \u201cnot believe in ADHD at all\u201d and says that autism is \u201ca much abused diagnosis\u201d, while other voices insist that parents whose disabled children get some dependable help from their local councils are the possessors of \u201ca golden ticket\u201d. In both cases, the insidious process is much the same. First, services fail. Then, casting doubt on the resulting pain and letting the people responsible off the hook, there are loud suggestions that levels of need may not have been that great in the first place. As a result, austerity can be recast as efficiency, a move that always appeals to politicians, of whatever party.\nMy other big worry relates to public trust, or what remains of it. Birmingham offers a case study in something almost completely missing from the national conversation: the fact that four years after the arrival of the pandemic the suffering people endured seems to count for almost nothing. In 2020 and 2021, lots of comparisons were made to this country\u2019s experience of the years after 1939. Keir Starmer, in fact, said that what we had been through meant people were \u201clooking for more from their government \u2013 like they were after the second world war\u201d. Is his new message to Alum Rock \u2013 and lots of other places \u2013 that even a modest version of 1945 is off limits and, having suffered, people will simply have to watch their councils crumble, and suffer again? Desiccated fiscal arithmetic offers no help with that challenge: this is a moral rather than a mathematical question, and it needs an answer.\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist"

        "teaser": "The Biden administration U-turned as its frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu grew. But don\u2019t expect much more",
        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 20.26 CET",
        "content": "The extent of the Biden administration\u2019s shift at the United Nations security council on Monday should not be underestimated. The US is not only by far Israel\u2019s most important ally and supplier of aid, but has provided it with stalwart diplomatic support. That it abstained instead of vetoing a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire \u2013 as it had previously done \u2013 was a major departure and leaves Israel looking extremely isolated, as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s angry reaction showed.\nYet the US has since done its best to talk down its decision, with officials insisting that there has been no change in policy and describing the resolution as non-binding. That is not the view of other security council members or the UN itself. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote that it would be \u201cunforgivable\u201d to fail to implement the resolution, which also called for the unconditional release of hostages. But Israeli airstrikes have continued.\nThe Biden administration is well aware that this war is ravaging its international standing: it is judged both complicit in the suffering in Gaza and ineffectual in its ability to restrain Israel\u2019s conduct of the war. At home, it is costing the president vital Democratic support in an election year. But more Americans believe that Israel\u2019s conduct of the war is acceptable than unacceptable, although there is a clear \u2013 and generational \u2013 divide.\nMike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, has already said that he will invite Mr Netanyahu to speak before Congress. Though many in Israel fully understand the long-term damage the Israeli prime minister has done to his country\u2019s interests as he fights for his own, there is no sign that US exasperation will speed his departure or moderate the conduct of this war.\nWhile the Biden administration treads gingerly, the humanitarian catastrophe gallops ahead in Gaza. The UN resolution stipulates a ceasefire for Ramadan \u2013 already half passed. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza\u2019s health authorities. Disease and starvation are claiming more lives as the most intense famine since the second world war takes hold \u2013 a famine entirely human-made by the destruction of so much of Gaza and the reduction of aid to a trickle. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees central to relief efforts, has said that Israel has banned it from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza.\nMr Biden has described the placing of conditions on US military aid as a \u201cworthwhile thought\u201d, but it does not appear to be one that he intends to translate into reality, though past administrations have threatened or imposed them. Recipients of arms must now give assurances that they abide by international law, but the US says it has \u201cno evidence\u201d that Israel is not in compliance. Many Democrats disagree.\nCanada has already announced that it is suspending further sales. The UK shifted from abstaining to supporting the ceasefire resolution on Monday, and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has urged the Foreign Office to publish its formal legal advice on whether Israel is breaching international law in Gaza. The reality is, however, that 99% of Israel\u2019s arms imports come from the US and Germany. Hand-wringing over humanitarian suffering is pointless when you continue to supply the weapons creating the disaster. Monday\u2019s abstention was an important symbolic moment, but it appears that little will alter unless the US makes a substantive change.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "teaser": "The Wall Street Journal correspondent is not a spy. He is a journalist, and should be released immediately from his Russian jail",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.38 CET",
        "content": "Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, has spent nearly a year in a Moscow prison, awaiting trial for a crime he did not commit. Mr Gershkovich was arrested last March in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and jailed on espionage charges. He is not a spy. He is a journalist, and should be released immediately. Hostage diplomacy lies behind his incarceration. As the US ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, said, Mr Gershkovich\u2019s case \u201cis not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends\u201d.\nVladimir Putin indicated in February that a prisoner exchange could lead to the release of Mr Gershkovich. There have been high-profile prisoner swaps in the past. In December 2022, Moscow traded a US basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia for a Russian arms trafficker. But a journalist\u2019s detention to secure the release of a Russian hitman would underscore Russia\u2019s retreat into a Soviet past. In 1986 an American journalist, Nicholas Daniloff, was arrested and charged with espionage. He was let go after two weeks when the US released a Soviet diplomat accused of spying. Mr\u00a0Gershkovich has been inside for nearly 12 months.\nRussia has turned away in the last decade from liberal democratic institutions such as a multiparty system, fair elections and a free press. These had taken root after the collapse of the Soviet Union but were unlikely to spring fully grown, like Athena from\u00a0the forehead of Zeus, given a history of tsarist and communist authoritarianism. After last Friday\u2019s horrific concert hall terror attacks outside Moscow,\u00a0western nations rightly stood with the Russian people. Releasing Mr Gershkovich would earn Mr\u00a0Putin\u2019s regime global goodwill when its fragility is in the spotlight.\nIn Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo jail, Mr Gershkovich has kept up his spirits by reading books and letters of support. Journalism is not a crime. Mr Gershkovich was fully accredited to report on Russia, and was doing his job when he was detained. He should never have been imprisoned. But the definition of espionage in Russia is so absurdly broad that the authorities can interpret reporting as spying. The country keeps a disproportionate number of foreign reporters behind bars. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says 12 of the global total of 17 non-local imprisoned journalists are held by Russia. Many foreign correspondents have left the country or been denied visas, and their dwindling numbers constrain those who remain even further.\nFor many Russian reporters, the profession turned deadly long ago. According to the CPJ, 43\u00a0journalists and media workers have been killed in Russia since Mr Putin came to power in 1999. Reporting that could be contrary to the state\u2019s narrative is now effectively illegal. The climate of fear has driven many Russian journalists out of the country they love.\nMany in Russia know that the defence of the free word offers inspiration to posterity. The list of\u00a0those, famous and anonymous, who struggled for\u00a0a free press in the country is a long one. Censorship will disfigure the nation\u2019s intellectual and cultural life. Mr Gershkovich understood this very well. \u201cReporting on Russia is now also a regular practice of watching people you know get locked away for years,\u201d he tweeted in 2022. Eight months later, he was in prison. His detention has been extended until 30 June, prolonging his nightmare. Moscow should set him free now.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "The Guardian view on unpaid care: time to heed Kate and Derek\u2019s story",
        "teaser": "Let us hope Kate Garraway\u2019s films spark a national conversation and serious change. Society is nothing without care",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 19.42 CET",
        "content": "It is an extraordinary story, it is an ordinary tragedy. Kate Garraway\u2019s documentaries about caring for her late husband, Derek Draper, have drawn huge publicity\u00a0and millions of viewers. That is partly testimony to the celebrity of the couple \u2013 a TV presenter and a New Labour politico \u2013 but it is mostly due to the power of their story. Covid ravaged every organ in Mr Draper\u2019s body so that, in the programme aired this week, viewers saw this vibrant, sharp-witted man confined to a bed, struggling to walk or to form sentences. \u201cHis brain was his best friend,\u201d Ms Garraway remarked at one point. \u201cNow it is like his brain is his enemy.\u201d Meanwhile, the work of caring for him pushed\u00a0 her to the edge financially, psychologically, even physically. The stress was so severe that she developed heart pains that forced her to attend hospital.Even amid this intimate suffering, Ms Garraway knows there are millions of other households in similar situations \u2013 except without her profile, access to expertise or high salary. Among the programme\u2019s most moving sections are the testimonies from other carers about negotiating bureaucracy and trying to manage. They borrow money from friends and family, they go to food banks, they are \u201cjust existing\u201d. The last census from 2021 found that 5 million people provide unpaid care to a loved one.\nThat is a sizable jump from a decade ago, and carers\u2019 organisations believe the current total is higher still \u2013 perhaps 10 million \u2013 after Covid. Yet they are practically invisible in our political conversation. Ministers and economists note that nearly 3\u00a0million\u00a0people are now long-term sick and worry about the impact on our labour force \u2013 but no one asks about the people looking after them.\nNews bulletins will regularly feature stories on the desperate erosion of the NHS and the crisis in social care \u2013 yet they rarely look into the lives of wives, husbands, sons and daughters who step in where the state has failed. Provision for these people, who do some of the most important work\u00a0in Britain\u00a0today, is almost risible. Carer\u2019s allowance\u00a0is\u00a0pitifully low, while parliament has only just granted employees a week\u2019s care leave a year \u2013 unpaid, naturally. Much of this neglect is age-old sexism, predicated\u00a0on the belief that it is women who will pick up the pieces, and they don\u2019t merit much attention. This is nonsense. If voluntary carers were\u00a0to withdraw their labour tomorrow, hospitals and council services would suffer an almighty deluge. They won\u2019t, of course. In sickness and in health, runs the old wedding vow, and for many people looking after their loved ones it is an expression of just that: love. But our carers do deserve a lot more care. When the next government grapples with the crisis in the NHS, it will have to think about the care sector, and as part of that it should think about how to support unpaid carers. That means more money to social care, and funding local health and social services to do more for families in the home. It also means leaning on employers. It may be easier for an accountant, say, to negotiate more flexibility at work so that they can care for a parent; but companies that provide precarious contracts and low pay also need to step up to the mark. Let us hope that Ms Garraway\u2019s films spark a national conversation and serious change. Society is nothing without care, and we would be nowhere without our invisible army of carers."

        "headline": "Britain is becoming a toxic chemical dumping ground \u2013 yet another benefit of Brexit",
        "author": "George Monbiot",
        "teaser": "Perhaps our government imagines bulldog spirit will protect us from the dangerous substances that Europe rules unsafe",
        "published": "Mon 18 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "It\u2019s a benefit of Brexit \u2013 but only if you\u2019re a manufacturer or distributor of toxic chemicals. For the rest of us, it\u2019s another load we have to carry on behalf of the shysters and corner-cutters who lobbied for the UK to leave the EU.\nThe government insisted on a separate regulatory system for chemicals. At first sight, it\u2019s senseless: chemical regulation is extremely complicated and expensive. Why replicate an EU system that costs many millions of euros and employs a small army of scientists and administrators? Why not simply adopt as UK standards the decisions it makes? After all, common regulatory standards make trading with the rest of Europe easier. Well, now we know. A separate system allows the UK to become a dumping ground for the chemicals that Europe rules unsafe.\nWhile negotiating our exit from the EU, the government repeatedly promised that environmental protections would not be eroded. In 2018, for example, the then environment secretary Michael Gove, in a speech titled Green Brexit, claimed \u201cnot only will there be no abandonment of the environmental principles that we\u2019ve adopted in our time in the EU, but indeed we aim to strengthen environmental protection measures\u201d. Such pledges turn out to be as dodgy as a \u00a33 coin with Boris Johnson\u2019s head on it.\nOur proudly sovereign regulatory system immediately descended into total chaos: chaos of the kind that the warlord capitalists who backed the leave campaign might have been hoping for. It took the UK\u2019s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) until last month to publish its chemicals regulation work programme for the financial year 2023-2024. That was, erm, six weeks before the period expired. You\u2019ll remember, of course, how Brexit would enable us to escape the \u201cinefficiencies\u201d of Brussels bureaucracy.\nAs the campaign group Chem Trust documents, our shadow version of the EU system, called UK Reach, is beset by underfunding, understaffing, a skills crisis and an impossible workload. It looks to me like the kind of failure-by-design that afflicts so much of environmental regulation in the UK.\nThis dysfunction leaves us exposed to toxins now being banned or restricted in Europe. For example, tetraethyl lead has long been banned from fuel for surface vehicles. But it continues to be used in aircraft fuel, ensuring we are sprayed with a chemical that causes neurological disorders. The EU, after long resisting the obvious step, has at last ruled that it must be phased out. But the UK hasn\u2019t. It will remain legal here. The same goes for endocrine-disrupting chemicals in children\u2019s toys, formaldehyde, brominated flame retardants and the microplastics intentionally added to fertilisers and artificial sport surfaces.\nThe EU is far from perfect. It has backtracked on some of its own commitments. But at least it\u2019s doing something about chemicals that cause cancers and other illnesses and devastate ecosystems. Since we left the bloc, UK regulators have yet to adopt a single new ban or restriction of a harmful substance. Brings a lump to the throat, this patriotic self-reliance, doesn\u2019t it? Or perhaps to the breast, or stomach, or liver.\nIn some respects, we\u2019ve even been spiralling backwards. The government has decided that workplace exposure limits on dimethylformamide, and restrictions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in synthetic sports pitches, of lead in PVC products and of hazardous substances in disposable nappies are \u201cnot a priority for action this year\u201d. Part of its reasoning is that it has yet to see evidence that these substances pose a risk that is \u201cspecific to Great Britain\u201d. Does their use in the UK present different risks to their identical use elsewhere? Perhaps the bulldog spirit of this sceptred isle protects us from chemicals that afflict the lesser beings overseas.\nIn the EU, there is now a total ban on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides \u2013 perhaps better labelled ecocides, thanks to their remarkably wide range of impacts. But every year since we left the EU, the UK government has granted an \u201cemergency\u201d exemption from the supposed ban here, following lobbying by sugar beet producers and the National Farmers Union. In August 2020, British Sugar asked for \u201cno more than three years\u2026 to give us time to develop alternatives\u201d. Given that it granted yet another authorisation in 2024, perhaps the government could ask British Sugar\u2019s managing director how his company is getting along. He shouldn\u2019t be hard to find. He\u2019s married to the health secretary.\nThe more we learn, the more we realise how dangerous chemicals approved without proper testing or consideration can be. New findings, for instance, on the health effects of PFAS compounds \u2013 \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2013 and on the ecological and health impacts of pesticides, and on the effects of microplastics in soil show why we should apply the precautionary principle. By the time we discover that a substance is more hazardous than first believed, it is embedded in our ecosystems, our bodies and our lives.\nWhile the UK government appears incapable of developing new public protections, it is also mysteriously unable, following lobbying, donations and taps on the shoulder, to uphold and enforce the regulations we do possess. Every body that\u2019s supposed to protect us from environmental harm \u2013 such as the Environment Agency or the HSE \u2013 is woefully underfunded, underpowered and demoralised. This is where most deregulation happens: not in the formation or de-formation of rules, which, at least in theory, is subject to parliamentary debate, but in the government\u2019s unwillingness to apply them, which is not.\nThis is why a group of us, called Fighting Dirty, are taking the government to court over its multiple failures to protect people and ecosystems from hazardous chemicals, beginning with its outrageous refusal to test or regulate the many toxins being spread on farmland in sewage sludge. We have just been granted permission for a high court hearing. Such legal actions, difficult and expensive as they are, are a last resort, when regulatory standards and the agencies supposed to uphold them have all but collapsed.\nBrexit was sold to us on the grounds of intangible gains: a sense of autonomy and pride, particularity and independence. These intangible gains are accompanied by tangible losses: real impacts on our health and wellbeing. We might have left the EU, but we did not escape the demands of predatory capital. Far from it: freed from European restraints, they trickle insidiously into our lives.\nGeorge Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\nJoin George Monbiot for a Guardian Live online event on Wednesday 8 May 2024 at 8pm BST.

        "headline": "For years, I saw sex as a competitive sport. Then I realised how empty I felt",
        "author": "Cornelia Holzbauer",
        "teaser": "I am still a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community, but I am happier since giving up casual encounters",
        "published": "Mon 4 Mar 2024 10.00 CET",
        "content": "Until recently, I used sexual encounters the same way others might a glass of wine after a long day, or some chocolate after a meal \u2013 before you know it, one glass can quickly turn into two or three, or a chocolate bar a day.\nHaving been single for almost five years, I found myself increasingly viewing sex as a competitive sport. It became a means to an end \u2013 an orgasm, a stress relief, a cure for boredom or loneliness. One time, I joked with my friends that I \u201cmasturbated with his body\u201d, referring to my latest conquest.\nI had been keenly aware of my casual approach towards sex for a while, but I didn\u2019t see it as a problem \u2013 I was never addicted to sex and had long been a proud member of the anti-slut-shaming community. I lived by the mantra: \u201cSingles deserve intimacy, too.\u201d\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s clear that I was confusing sex with intimacy. I thought: \u201cJust because I am not in a relationship, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get to have all the sex my heart desires.\u201d But what started as an empowered \u201cI am different, I wear my nymphomania as a badge of honour\u201d journey soon snowballed into saying \u201cyes\u201d when I should have really said \u201cno\u201d.\nLast summer, I slept with a man with whom I had a rare, electric chemistry. But at 7am, after about four hours of sleep, he woke me rudely and asked me to leave \u2013 he told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep\u201d while I was there. I gathered my stuff and left, after asking him to book me an Uber. Five minutes into the ride, the driver informed me it had been cancelled. When I called the man to ask what had happened, he said I \u201chad been cold to him\u201d upon my departure. My jaw fell to the floor as I found myself stranded somewhere in Upper Manhattan.\nLast autumn, I met a man via a dating app and slept with him on the first date. After we were done \u2013 it was already 3am \u2013 he declared that he\u2019d have to go home now. Taken aback, I inquired why he wouldn\u2019t just stay over and leave in the morning. His response: \u201cSleeping next to a woman is too intimate. I\u2019d risk her falling in love with me.\u201d\nI can think of at least 10 more similar situations where I felt belittled, sidelined, slut-shamed or all of the above. But what haunts me the most is that I know I have done the same to some of my sexual partners in the past. My numbness led me to believe that this was normal behaviour in the jungle that is otherwise known as casual sex among singles.\nMy unhealthy relationship with sex came to an unceremonious end with the help of social media and a good cry. In November, inspired by the social media trend \u201cDating Wrapped\u201d, where singles post slideshow presentations summing up their year of dating, I counted the number of people I had bedded in the last year \u2013 20. I was shocked by the relatively high number, considering almost none of them had made me feel fulfilled, excited or empowered.\nMany of those encounters had been so forgettable that I had trouble recalling how I felt during or after, or found myself zoning out and thinking of something else while doing the deed. I had sometimes said \u201cyes\u201d to sleeping with someone simply because they asked, even if I wasn\u2019t attracted to them.\nLooking back, there was no one big lightbulb moment that led me to quitting casual encounters. (That might not have worked anyway; going cold turkey after years of bingeing may lead to relapses.) But sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner table surrounded by my happily married parents and my sister, her fiance and toddler, I found myself sobbing uncontrollably. The juxtaposition between my life and theirs suddenly dawned on me: \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time someone I liked held my hand or hugged me.\u201d\nI knew I needed to stop having sex with anybody other than myself \u2013 a realisation born out of pure exhaustion. I now have one rule for my current existence: I won\u2019t sleep with anyone for whom I don\u2019t have romantic feelings. It\u2019s been almost four months since I had a sexual encounter (what I used to call a \u201cdry spell\u201d), and I am feeling cleansed. The \u201csugar\u201d and \u201ctoxins\u201d are leaving my body \u2013 or rather, my mind \u2013 and I am clear and focused. It\u2019s a whole new world for me, and I feel excited, dedicating the time I used to spend recruiting my next lead, and later crying to my therapist, on my career instead.\nOf course, there are withdrawal symptoms. They usually kick in when I encounter a sex scene in a TV show or movie, or when I witness a friend going home with someone after a night out. But I am starting to realise that sex is not a numbers game and that intimacy and sex can be entirely different things.\nWhile my body is closed for business, my heart is open for romance.\nCornelia Holzbauer is a health and wellness journalist based in New York City\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "Visiting a whites-only town in South Africa was difficult. Even sadder was the racist backlash in the UK",
        "author": "Ade Adepitan",
        "teaser": "I expected criticism of my documentary, but the racist trolling and support for an apartheid stronghold was truly awful",
        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 10.00 CET",
        "content": "The morning after my most recent documentary, Whites Only: Ade\u2019s Extremist Adventure, aired on Channel 4, I got a stream of concerned phone calls and WhatsApp messages from friends, family members and work colleagues, asking if I was OK. At first I was confused. It wasn\u2019t until they started talking about social media that I understood why they were all so worried. I\u2019d pretty much removed myself from X (formerly Twitter) a few months ago: it was just becoming a place of polarised conversations that made the platform toxic and close to unusable.\nI knew there would be an extreme reaction to the documentary as sadly, the topic of race, especially in connection with South Africa, will probably always be provocative in our lifetime. In my documentary, I visit an all-white town called Orania in the central Karoo region of South Africa. The film is a pilot for a potential series where I would meet a whole range of extreme groups across the globe, including those attracting Black and Asian people. I wanted to understand why these people held such extreme views, what the consequences were, and what lessons could be learned. I also knew many of our viewers had never heard of Orania, so just seeing the town and its inhabitants for them would be a new experience.\nOver the last 20 years, I have made or been involved in documentaries covering a wide range of topics, from exiled Cuban athletes to the illegal trade of exotic animals from the Amazon, where I wore a hidden camera and posed as a wealthy buyer. I was the first journalist in a wheelchair to travel to Mogadishu. In Mexico City, I was almost kidnapped and had to be evacuated by the police from my hotel room. I\u2019ve accepted that this profession can be hazardous, but also feel lucky and privileged to be given access into the lives of some extremely fascinating people.\nMy style of film-making is to go into every issue, asking the question \u201cwhy\u201d in as many different ways as I can. Hopefully, I bring the viewers with me and we learn together. But I realise my method leaves me vulnerable and open to attack. This is par for the course for anyone in the public eye. But let\u2019s be honest: if you\u2019re a Black journalist, the level of abuse you can expect to receive on social media is horrific; add disability to the mix and it turns into a mindless anger fest.\nThe result: an online army of haters who criticise me for being me. People who can\u2019t see beyond the colour of my skin, so anything I do or say will be wrong. I received comments like these:\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m actually glad a fucking racist like you is crippled.\u201d\u201cDelusions of grandeur and ignorance to the fact he\u2019s from an underdeveloped subspecies and way out of his depth.\u201d\u201cHas anyone noticed the morphology on that black African? My gosh, he has extremely archaic features, very chimpanzee like \u2026\u201d, \u201cthey should have lashed him to a plough and put him to work.\u201d\n\u201cI love how they not only they sent a negro, but a disabled one at that, just so they can farm as much outrage as possible.\u201d\u201cSounds like my perfect place! Free of Muslims and blacks. Maybe we can create areas like this in the UK \u2026 separate schools, shops, businesses etc etc sounds bliss.\u201d\nThis is just a tiny snapshot of what was waiting for me. I hope the mindless hatred I received online was just a noisy minority, and not the tip of a racist iceberg. But I do worry about the tone and leadership of our debate. Look at how long it took the UK government to call the Tory donor Frank Hester\u2019s deeply offensive comments about the MP Diane Abbott racist. Or the fact that, a week later, the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch \u2013 having dubbed his comments racist \u2013 tried to minimise them: \u201cThis was something that happened five years ago \u2026 it wasn\u2019t even really about Diane Abbott \u2026 This is trivia.\u201d It makes me worry that if we don\u2019t start to have proper, honest conversations about race, followed by actions that lead to tangible change in our society, racism will be constantly weaponised and used to divide us.\nSome thought I should have gone in there guns blazing, a trigger-happy Black cowboy verbally shooting down every comment I disagreed with. But what is the point of that? In my view, when you make a documentary, you have to let people be heard, let them speak, and through that process, reveal their true selves, so the audience can make up its own mind. I could fight, shout, argue but all that does is polarise us more.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to be there in Orania, to be honest, but we wanted to stay and fulfil what we had set out to do, and not lose access on day one.\nThere was criticism, some here in the Guardian,and there was hate elsewhere, but there was also positivity, lots of it across Facebook, Instagram and X, as well as in some print media. That\u2019s what I take heart from: \u201c\u201cI had no idea this place existed. It\u2019s blown my mind,\u201d was one tweet I received. \u201cLordy, lord, that place is a cult-like construction site,\u201d said another. \u201cThe prejudices and worldview of the adult population is disturbing enough, but the kids who grow up under the glass dome.Just wow.\u201d \u201cWhat an eye opener,\u201d tweeted a third. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re stuck in some sort of weird apartheid timewarp. Well done for seeing it out.\u201d\nI know so many Black people in the UK are tired of talking about racism, not because they think it doesn\u2019t exist but because it feels so embedded in society and progress is so slow. But this is exactly the reason why we have to keep pushing for change in whatever way we can.\nMaybe in our own small way we have started a conversation, even among the online trolls. From what I\u2019ve learned over the years, change begins with you and me at a dinner table, in a taxi or in our homes, having a conversation.\nAde Adepitan is a journalist and broadcaster.

        "headline": "Does China spy on Britain? Of course. But we have more important things to discuss with them",
        "author": "Simon Jenkins",
        "teaser": "While diplomatic rows are inevitable, the priority is to keep channels open,  and engage with Beijing about the climate crisis",
        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "Once upon a time Britain would have sent a gunboat up the Yangtze River. That would teach those Chinese a lesson. To hear some MPs talk about Beijing\u2019s espionage activities, you would think gunboats were already on their way.\nOf course, it is malicious and hurtful for a foreign state patently to hack into Britain\u2019s Electoral Commission and target senior parliamentarians \u2013 as the government on Monday claimed China did in 2021. It is equally malicious to fabricate MPs\u2019 emails and use a Commons researcher as an informant. No less evil is the culture of fear sown among Britain\u2019s 150,000 Chinese students by agents of Beijing, albeit tolerated by British universities greedy for money.\nHow to react is another matter. Rishi Sunak was quick to the fray. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that the situation now is that China is behaving in an increasingly assertive way abroad, authoritarian at home, and it represents an epoch-defining challenge, and also the greatest state-based threat to our economic security,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s right that we take measures to protect ourselves, which is what we are doing.\u201d That was clear. It was also ridiculous. On Sunday night, an equally absurd BBC political bubble programme, the Westminster Hour on Radio 4, seemed to regard war as at hand. MPs demanded that the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, \u201ccall out China\u201d, rather as though it had broken a Garrick Club rule. Beijing was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. There should be \u201cconsequences\u201d. The Yangtze gunboat was clearing its decks.\nBut ahead of that, Dowden was indeed having his say. There will be a reckoning, he promised MPs, more sanctions. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, who is said to have been targeted alongside other parliamentarians in the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, was also blunt. China is not just a challenge to us, he said. It must be framed as a threat. \u201cAs they grow in power and potency, we are shrinking before them,\u201d he said.\nStill, I doubt if this gets even a news-in-brief in the People\u2019s Daily. Britain\u2019s parliament cannot be a big deal in the hierarchy of Beijing security. The fulminations of Duncan Smith will hardly have had the People\u2019s Liberation Army straining at the leash. It is sound and fury, much like at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when any British minister meeting a Chinese host was told always \u201cto raise issues concerning Uyghur human rights\u201d. A Chinese acquaintance told me it became comical, \u201clike the Brits saying grace or asking about the weather\u201d.\nBritish diplomacy still exists in a mist of lost imperial power. China, meanwhile, is expanding its global influence exactly as the west once did. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) now extends across Asia, Africa and Europe. Its investments have advanced China\u2019s interests but also the lives of those it assists. BRI has, incidentally, been much to the gain of the City of London, in construction, banking, insurance and professional services. Realpolitik is how it works. The fate of the Uyghurs never stopped David Cameron and George Osborne begging for Chinese cash for power stations and railways; business was business.\nToday the world\u2019s relations with China are in one area crucial. That country is responsible for more than a quarter of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and rising. Britain is now actively participating in China\u2019s proposed \u201cgreening\u201d of its BRI programme, which is largely about infrastructure. Given that a third of all greenhouse gas emissions are from construction \u2013 a fact still ignored by British planning policy \u2013 this collaboration with China is central to fighting the climate crisis. It is not about diplomatic posturing. It is about something essential.\nThe reality is that all states spy on each other, mostly to no effect and at vast cost. Nothing justifies hacking other people\u2019s emails, but a helping of public outrage and a few Chinese diplomats sent packing should be enough to restore Westminster\u2019s machismo. It is also clear that international action is needed to police the darker regions of the digital universe, where the entire world is wandering without a candle.\nBut, for all these concerns, a sense of proportion remains the hardest but most necessary quality to maintain in international relations. We are told daily that global heating is the greatest threat now facing the world. Unless that applies only before lunch, then it should surely lie at the centre of all relations with China.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

        "headline": "Netanyahu has been spoiling for a fight with the US. He may not survive this one",
        "author": "Alon Pinkas",
        "teaser": "The UN vote for a Gaza ceasefire shows Biden\u2019s administration has finally lost patience with Israel\u2019s leader. That could be crucial ",
        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 17.47 CET",
        "content": "How do you gaslight an entire nation about a war and then try to do the same to a superpower that is your ally? And how do you turn a just war into global isolation and widespread condemnation? Just ask Benjamin Netanyahu. He has the patent.\nNetanyahu has been deliberately and intently seeking a confrontation with the US ever since late October. The UN security council resolution 2728, demanding an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d, is just the latest pretext for this premeditated showdown. This may sound counterintuitive and imprudent to you, given that the two countries are close allies, given Israel\u2019s heavy reliance on US military aid and its diplomatic umbrella, and particularly given President Biden\u2019s sweeping and unwavering support for Israel since the 7 October catastrophe.\nBut Netanyahu has two reasons to instigate such a confrontation. The first is pure gaslighting on a grand scale. He concocted a narrative that supposedly explains the war\u2019s context and consequently absolves him from the responsibility and accountability he persistently refuses to assume. It also distracts from his stated policy of imploring Qatar to funnel more funds to Gaza to strengthen Hamas, all in order to weaken the Palestinian Authority and render any political negotiations impossible.\nAccording to this narrative, 7 October was simply a debacle that could have been averted had the Israel Defense Forces and Shabak intelligence not failed. The bigger problem now, according to Netanyahu, is the possibility of a Palestinian state that the world, especially the US, has been trying to impose on Israel since the attack. According to this narrative, only a heroic Netanyahu can stand up to the US, defy an American president and prevent this travesty.\nNow of course it is impossible that a new Palestinian state could be \u201cimposed\u201d from outside. But this framing allows Netanyahu to placate his rightwing extremist coalition and partners, who have long opposed any form of Palestinian statehood. And it lets him make conflict with the US a focal point, rather than his own failures. It\u2019s not about the Louis XIV wannabe prime minister. It never is.\nThe second reason is more current and practical: the confrontation is about setting up Biden as the scapegoat for Netanyahu\u2019s failure to achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d or \u201cthe eradication of Hamas\u201d, two fortune cookie-type slogans that he spews regularly.\nThe security council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire, adopted by 14 members with the US abstaining, puts Israel on a double collision course: with the UN security council but more critically, with the US. Netanyahu\u2019s sanctimonious tantrums about how \u201csurprised\u201d he was and how the US abstention is a departure from policy that would prevent victory is mendacious. He was warned repeatedly by the Biden administration that this would be an inevitable outcome if he persisted with his endless recalcitrance, defiance and effective refusal to engage with the US, ostensibly Israel\u2019s staunch ally and protector.\nWhen you ignore US requests, dismiss the president\u2019s well-intentioned advice, inundate the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, with duplicitous spin, casually deride US plans and ideas for a reconfigured region, show crude intransigence by refusing to present a credible and coherent vision for postwar Gaza, hold a video call with Republican senators (a group that Netanyahu feels he is a life member of) and actively pursue an open confrontation with the administration, there\u2019s a price to pay. Most recently, Blinken\u2019s state department has warned Israel that it is increasingly isolated and is in danger of inflicting \u201cgenerational damage\u201d to its reputation and image.\nHad Israel seriously engaged with the US on any of the above issues, without necessarily agreeing to everything, it would have prevented this rift. The US has one long-running fundamental contention with Israel: the lack of a coherent political objective for the war, with which military means must be aligned. The US inquired time after time about Israel\u2019s goals and got nothing but \u201ctopple Hamas\u201d, which is a worthy goal, but does not address the \u201cday after\u201d.\nIn respect of the security council, Israel will conveniently explain to itself that the resolution is not a big deal, that there is no imminent threat of sanctions and anyway, the UN was always and remains anti-Israeli. Perhaps. But that\u2019s not the point. The resolution puts Israel in a very unpleasant and precarious place to be for a country, let alone a democracy and a US ally. The more critical and consequential arena is US-Israel relations. Their deterioration under Netanyahu has been well documented over the past year, but the security council resolution represents a new low.\nSince around January time, the US has negatively revised its assessment of Israel under Netanyahu. He does not behave as an ally, he has accrued a debilitating credibility deficit over the years on a multitude of issues, and he has intentionally failed to come up with a plan for postwar Gaza \u2013 to the point where he is now seriously suspected in Washington of prolonging the war for his own political survival antics. The current showdown over the security council resolution widens the rift to the point that it is impossible to see how the trajectory will change as long as Netanyahu is in power.\nAt the moment, the US has three points of disagreement with Israel regarding the details of the prosecution of the war: the notion that Israel is impeding humanitarian aid; the number of civilian non-combatant deaths; and a possible military invasion of Rafah, on the southern tip of Gaza. These differences could have been resolved had Netanyahu and Biden had a working, honest and good-faith relationship. They do not. In fact, Netanyahu has a track record of confrontations and frequent spats with US administrations, from George HW Bush through to Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and now Biden. His \u2013 unsuccessful, it must be added \u2013 meddling in US politics is also a familiar trait of his since the 1990s.\nThe current state of relations is close to an inflection point, and could go in one of two directions: either Netanyahu is ousted or leaves or loses an election, or the US will be convinced that the bilateral ecosystem has faltered and warrants a major reassessment of relations. Under Netanyahu, Israel has reached the point at which its very value as an ally is being questioned. It took the US some time, but it finally seems to realise a simple fact: Israel may be an ally, but Netanyahu most certainly is not.\nAlon Pinkas served as Israel\u2019s consul general in New York from 2000 to 2004.

        "author": "Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett",
        "teaser": "Across Britain, families are calling for an end to the violence. But what should be shared and discussed with younger members?",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 10.00 CET",
        "content": "It is always at bedtime that the horror of Gaza hits Naila Khan. \u201cYou know the images of those Palestinian parents, where they\u2019re rocking their dead child?\u201d she asks me, from Manchester. \u201cEvery evening when I\u2019m rocking my child, all I can imagine is those mothers holding their children and I think to myself: my child is breathing, is alive, is healthy, safe, has got shelter. We\u2019re not being bombed.\u201d\nKhan is a mother of four and, like many parents, she is struggling to process this war and the horrific impact on the children of Gaza. The death toll is unprecedented in our lifetimes, as is the on-the-ground footage we are seeing. I now understand why my mother couldn\u2019t watch the news for years after I was born, and yet I can\u2019t turn away. This war has galvanised my friends and acquaintances on social media, many of them parents. I get a lot of parenting content from Instagram, and use the platform to share my experiences. The horrifying footage of dead and injured children and distressed parents is now mixed in \u2013 it is a constant on my feed \u2013 eroding any barrier to empathy that might have existed between us before the age of social media.\nIt is important to bear witness, but some parents, like Khan, are going beyond that. It is difficult enough for adults to compute the war in Gaza and the slaughter of 7 October. How do you begin to explain it to children? Islamophobia and antisemitism are on the rise in the UK, and incidents in schools will mean some difficult and painful conversations taking place in British homes.\nKhan, a primary school teacher, founded the group Creative Kindness because she was concerned about the emotional impact of the war on children. Last month, she organised a \u201cWatermelon Seeds March\u201d to MediaCity in Salford. Parents and kids laid down clothes, shoes and teddy bears in tribute to the more than 13,000 Palestinian children that have been killed by Israel. \u201cChildren are observing all this, and we don\u2019t know the drastic effects it\u2019s going to have on them,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe are providing them with a safe space and an outlet to release their emotions and their innermost feelings \u2026 through drawing and creative art therapy.\u201d Before the march, children made placards and kites \u2013 a poignant symbol of the children of Gaza, who in 2011 broke the world record for the most flown simultaneously.\nThe delicate balance between honesty and shielding your child from the scale of the massacre is a tough one to tread. Omar, a father of one and a Syrian refugee who works for a refugee charity, became involved with the group Parents for Palestine after he saw their \u201cteddy blockade\u201d outside the Foreign Office in October. The London-based coalition of parents and caregivers came together to protest and express their shared grief, which has led to them forming \u201cfamily bloc\u201d spaces at anti-war demonstrations and carrying out smaller, child-friendly actions. \u201cI try to protect my son as much as I can,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I try to balance it. It\u2019s not correct to stay silent.\u201d His son, who is six, was upset to learn in October that 3,000 children had been killed. \u201cSince then, every couple of days he\u2019s asked me, what\u2019s the number now? I tried to fake it. I tell him it\u2019s 3,001. I know it\u2019s more, but I don\u2019t want to affect him.\u201d\nOmar\u2019s friend Zaina was one of the first people to become involved in Parents for Palestine, and has found it a great comfort. A Palestinian mother of one, she was in the West Bank visiting family with her baby daughter when the Hamas attacks on 7 October and the subsequent Israeli invasion unfolded. Returning to the UK and encountering a political narrative that paints Palestinians as extremists and terrorists put her, she says, \u201cin a dark place mentally\u201d. Her daughter is too young to know what\u2019s going on, but Zaina worries about her future because of her mixed heritage. \u201cHer whole existence is not safe in this country, because she carries multiple identities,\u201d she says.\nLike many parents, Zaina has found the group a \u201chealing space\u201d; being with others who feel similarly helps. This need for community in the face of such tragedy is one of the reasons the online group Mothers Against Genocide was formed. \u201cWe came together, first of all, to support each other, because we were finding we were scrolling on our phones at night and not sleeping and crying,\u201d says cofounder and mother of two Nuala N\u00ed Scoll\u00e1in. What began as a WhatsApp group is now an Instagram community with more than 27,000 followers. Coming from the Irish language community of west Belfast, she had always had sympathy with the Palestinian cause \u201cbecause we were oppressed ourselves\u201d, but it was the stark contrast between her own situation and theirs which spurred her to action. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but imagine that that\u2019s your child.\u201d\nI would be lying if I said that parenthood hadn\u2019t made me more viscerally affected by children\u2019s suffering, but no one is suggesting that being a parent gives you greater empathy. \u201cThat need to protect: you don\u2019t need to have birthed a child to have that within you,\u201d N\u00ed Scoll\u00e1in says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the basic foundations of humanity. Our roles as elders to those children is that we are there for their protection, for their development, to nourish them, to make them feel loved and needed in the world.\u201d\nPerhaps it is that instinct that has seen a particular quote from James Baldwin, who loved children but never had his own, proliferating on placards at demonstrations and across social media: \u201cThe children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognising this may be incapable of morality.\u201d\nRhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Lara Rodwell",
        "teaser": "Comments about our differences used to wound me. But then I was forced to confront my decades-long resentment",
        "published": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 09.00 CET",
        "content": "\u201cWhy are you fat, and why is she thin,\u201d a puzzled middle-aged man asked, as my identical twin Katy and I strolled into a restaurant in central Mumbai for a post-yoga samosa. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had been asked this question \u2013 but each time it hurt just as much, and stoked a decades-long resentment towards my sister, who was always being told she was better looking than me.\nAs children, we had relished in our identicalness and were joined at the hip. Physically, the only way people (even family members) could tell us apart was by our face shape. I had a slightly rounder face than Katy, with chubby cheeks that earned me the nickname Chipmunk growing up. Katy and I got the same grades, had the same interests, and on birthdays and Christmases got given identical gifts \u2013 but in different colours. We were inextricably \u201cone\u201d.\nBut when we were 13, the cracks began to show. At secondary school we begrudgingly agreed to be separated into different classes, forcing both of us to stand on our own feet for the first time. As the more naive sister, I trusted that our separation would be good for us in time \u2013 that it might help us to forge our own individuality within our closeness. Katy, on the other hand, struggled with her newfound independence.\nIt began with a skipped meal here and there, and an extra walk around the block at lunchtime. After a few months of restrictive dieting and obsessive exercising, Katy had started to lose weight, and a close family member noticed the stark difference in physical appearance between the two of us. Suddenly, we weren\u2019t identical any more.\nOver the next seven years, Katy was in and out of psychiatric units across the country, being treated for anorexia. I expressed my grief through frustrated, teary outbursts where I begged her to \u201cjust eat, like a normal person\u201d. I would visit her after school, at weekends and in the holidays, feeling abandoned, lost and rejected. We refer to this period of our life as the years we \u201chated each other\u201d. I hated the fact I couldn\u2019t live my life as a \u201cnormal\u201d teenager, and she hated how much I hated her.\nAs Katy recovered, our relationship improved. But comments on our physical differences persisted, and they started to affect me. One guy at a party even dared to say to his friend, in earshot: \u201cI\u2019m more attracted to Katy because she\u2019s thinner than Lara.\u201d Our trip to India together had been about trying to repair our fractious bond and embark on yoga teacher training together \u2013 but the comments followed us there, too.\nI realised all the resentment I had been carrying for the past seven years was starting to express itself in a self-destructive and toxic way. I had started to hate myself. I felt less than, invisible, and defeated by my sister\u2019s illness; as if I could never just be enough the way I am. I entertained fantasies that she would always be the more attractive, thinner twin that everyone rallied around. My self-worth had evaporated and I started to lose weight. For two years, we became competitors.\nBut when our dad died three years ago, it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I realised that life was too short to keep comparing myself with my sister, and tying my identity and self-worth to our identicalness.\nI read self-help books religiously to try to improve my body image and self-esteem, like Health at Every Size and Women Don\u2019t Owe you Pretty. I listened to podcasts like Seems Like Diet Culture and ritualised cringe-worthy daily affirmations that I performed in the mirror.\nNow, when people comment on our differences, the result is night and day. Sometimes I still feel insecure, but there are more liberating moments, too, when I think, \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with being bigger than my twin sister, anyway?\u201d It was only when I stopped feeling like the victim of other people\u2019s judgments \u2013 which are ultimately out of my control \u2013 that I finally stopped comparing my weight, size and perceived attractiveness with my twin sister. In doing so, I was able to regain the self-confidence I once had, and finally allow our twinship to truly thrive.\nLara Rodwell is a freelance journalist and author\nIn the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

        "author": "Nomi Kaltmann",
        "teaser": "An outdated approach to women and children keeps me from my place of worship. Without more openness, it has no future",
        "published": "Thu 21 Mar 2024 16.22 CET",
        "content": "I vividly recall the moment I made the decision to stop attending synagogue. It happened in 2023, a few months after welcoming my fourth child.\nMy husband and I had managed to get our children dressed and out of the door that Saturday morning \u2013 a feat any parent with small children will recognise, and we arrived in time for the synagogue\u2019s children\u2019s service, a segment lasting about 30 minutes of the larger 2.5-hour service. But our plans were quickly derailed. The children\u2019s programme concluded earlier than anticipated and the playroom was closed, under instructions from the management.\nI felt trapped. I knew that my young children would inevitably make noise, attracting disapproval from older men in the main sanctuary. Determined to find a resolution, I approached a synagogue rabbi and requested that, for that week, he would allow the play area to remain open. He agreed and I breathed a sigh of relief.\nBut a week later, the president of the synagogue called to reprimand me for being rude and demanding. Wow, I thought, frustration surging within me. I had reached my limit. If advocating for a space for children to play, allowing them to actively participate in synagogue, is deemed demanding, then I want no part in it, I thought.\nThe exchange strikes me as an accurate example of the outdated approach of too many synagogues that do not take women and children\u2019s needs into account. Although some are making efforts to improve their amenities, many older ones still have outdated facilities that overlook the necessity for adaptable spaces capable of accommodating noise, children and their caregivers.\nSome buildings lack ramps for people with disabilities or accessibility for those that require it. Breastfeeding mothers often have no access to private space to nurse their children. Instead of embracing the lively sounds of young children, indicative of continuity and a growing community, elderly men persistently shush any children who make noise. Many women I know, especially those with one or two children, have simply stopped attending because the conditions make it impossible.\nIn Orthodox Judaism, the practice of separate seating places the ladies\u2019 gallery out of sight, contributing to women feeling like mere spectators, a concern frequently overlooked by those leading the services. Hardly any Orthodox synagogues have women in leadership, and even fewer have female presidents.\nEven with awareness of these limitations, for many years, my desire to attend synagogue each week persisted. To me, showing up represented a form of leadership. Indeed, in mid-2023 I achieved a significant milestone as one of the world\u2019s first Orthodox female rabbis. While women are unable to hold leadership positions in the synagogue, I am able to teach Torah, answer questions about Jewish law and provide pastoral support on matters of faith and tradition.\nBut, despite progress in some areas, it is clear that there is still a hostility towards women, children and their needs. Synagogues, like many other religious places of worship in the 21st century, are grappling with membership challenges. A significant number of them face the issue of ageing congregations, with entire generations of young people, unlike their parents and grandparents, showing little inclination to purchase memberships. Some synagogues have had to sell their buildings, other congregations have merged and many are desperate to fill their pews on a weekly basis.\nI live in Melbourne but this is a global problem, and a quick peek into any synagogue in most places will show you that they have rows of seats to fill. But I\u2019m not sure how synagogue leaders anticipate filling the pews if they are intolerant to the joyous noise of children \u2013 the next generation of potential members.\nWhile many communities like to hold roundtable conversations about why young Jews are no longer going to synagogue or considering buying memberships, I can tell you first-hand that there is not a lot of introspection about how they treat the women and youngest Jews who come through their doors.\nSometimes my husband still goes to synagogue with the kids, but I choose to sit it out. Other times, I take my children to the park or attend a more informal, ad-hoc service outside a synagogue with my friends.\nMy generation of young Jews envisions a dynamic Judaism that isn\u2019t tethered to a physical building but understands the need for synagogues to adapt if they are to survive. Owning expensive properties and buildings isn\u2019t enough; leaders must take thoughtful measures to make both inhabitants and guests feel welcome, especially women and children. Synagogues and their management have a lot more work to do to meet 21st-century standards.\nNomi Kaltmann is an Orthodox female rabbi and the Australian correspondent at Tablet Magazine (NYC)"

        "published": "Mon 25 Mar 2024 15.00 CET",
        "content": "Could I eat another bite? I turned this over in my head as I scanned the passenger seat of my car, piled high with takeaway containers of chicken wings. Being overfull was a familiar feeling in my work as a food critic. That crisp October day, the question was also existential \u2013 I had simply reached the end of the road.\nI\u2019d been thrilled to land my job nearly six years earlier at a newspaper covering the 3 million people and 10,000+ restaurants of New York City\u2019s eastern suburbs. I\u2019d grown up on Long Island reading Newsday, an award-winning powerhouse in the 80s and 90s, and years later had returned home for a job I initially loved. Driving hundreds of miles a week, I sometimes ate out four or five times a day as I pursued stories. Ribeye, oysters, cumin lamb, birria tacos \u2013 much of it went on my corporate credit card. The hustle was constant but the reward was unearthing under-the-radar places, dishes and people. I also wrote about wine, beer, coffee, and cocktails, which meant rubbing elbows with talented brewers and bartenders.\nWhenever someone asked what I did for a living, their eyes lit up at the response. \u201cI\u2019m a food writer,\u201d I\u2019d say, deliberately avoiding the word \u201ccritic\u201d, which sounded pompous and was actually my least favourite part of writing about food. \u201cStop. You get paid to eat? What a hard life! You have my dream job,\u201d they would invariably say.\nFrom the outside, it was a dream, and complaining seemed ungracious. So, I rarely told anyone that the work was not for the faint of heart. Literally. I lurched from plate to plate, deadline to deadline, postponing medical appointments and taking work on \u201cvacation\u201d so often that it became a running joke among friends. On the odd occasion I made it to the doctor, my blood levels told an ominous story. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that number a little lower,\u201d said my doctor as she studied my soaring cholesterol. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t control what I eat,\u201d I told her.\nDuring the pandemic, eaters pivoted hard toward lasagna, fried-chicken sandwiches, mac and cheese, and cocktails to go. In turn, our team pivoted from reviews to review-esque listicles. Reporting these entailed calorific culinary surveys. Some food writers I knew had honed the art of taking one bite of everything; if I really loved a dish, I\u2019d eat more, and maybe even finish it off. I watched my weight tick upward, and workouts and daily walks had minimal effect.The occasional bout of food poisoning was a job hazard, yet it was long-term overconsumption that took the real toll.\n\u201cDid we try Lipitor?\u201d My doctor squinted at the screen. \u201cOh, yeah, we did. What was the problem again?\u201d \u201cMade my legs hurt,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhat about Livalo?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy insurance won\u2019t cover it,\u201d I told her. \u201cWell, take it easy,\u201d she warned. \u201cBecause it looks like you\u2019re also pre-diabetic.\u201d\nI processed this news while tucking into fish tacos down the street. I couldn\u2019t just not eat the tacos, or pappardelle, or Korean fried chicken, could I?\nThat may have marked the beginning of the end. Or maybe there were a few endings in succession \u2013 from the pseudo-vacations and listicle fatigue to a heart arrhythmia that required an ablation. Two days after the procedure, as I recuperated at home covered in welts, an editor texted me about a story revision.\nI hung on for another year but began to daydream about cooking at home more than one or two nights a week, about burrowing out from under infinite leftovers. It was six orders of wings in a single afternoon that finally did me in. From the front seat of my car \u2013 which doubled as an office, table, and photo studio \u2013 I wet-wiped sweet-chilli sauce from my fingers and requested a Zoom call with my boss.\n\u201cMy time at the paper has come to an end,\u201d I told her. She leaned forward. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nI was. Afterwards, I felt wobbly but buoyant, as if I had instantly dropped an enormous weight. I also wondered if I\u2019d done something phenomenally stupid. Media colleagues were losing their jobs at a steady clip, and I recalled the sting of being laid off from prior positions. My journalist\u2019s savings account was less than robust.\nI didn\u2019t have much time to ruminate, as my story was due soon. Inside the next place, I took a seat at the bar, as I often did when eating alone, and ordered the wings scarpariello-style. Lacquered in a zingy vinegar sauce, they were excellent. I sampled a few while watching football on the bar TV along with the cooks, who were awaiting the dinner rush. The pandemic-era plexiglass separators were gone, and the place had reclaimed a long-absent airiness. It was the kind of detail that wouldn\u2019t make it into an SEO-optimised listicle.\nIt would take a few months to retrain the colossal appetite my body had become accustomed to, but I hoped that, down the road, those months would earn me a few extra years. I miss my colleagues and a regular paycheck \u2014 entrepreneurial life can be a roller coaster \u2014 but 15 months on, I\u2019ve reversed the weight gain, lowered my cholesterol without meds, and I\u2019m no longer pre-diabetic. The most unexpected shift, though, is the reverse-aging power of stress reduction. \u201cYou look so different,\u201d more than one friend has said. \u201cYou just look\u2026.relaxed.\u201d\nCorin Hirsch is a writer who covers food, drink, and travel\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "published": "Tue 26 Mar 2024 15.23 CET",
        "content": "So sad to see the Conservative party talking down Britain in its new attack ad for the London mayoral elections, which \u2013 among other deliberate and unethical lies \u2013 included footage of commuters fleeing false reports of gunfire in New York\u2019s Penn station in 2017. That bit has now been edited out, but what remains of the ad purports to be a 90-second portrait of life in the capital since London mayor Sadiq Khan \u201cseized power\u201d. Given that Khan has twice won the London mayoralty in free and fair votes, this feels somewhat punchy talk from a party led by an unelected man who himself \u201cseized power\u201d from the salad-vanquished political corpse of an unelected woman.\nBut look, what\u2019s the worst that can happen if political parties tell blatant untruths to people, debase campaigning standards and conduct knowing assaults on trust? If only there were places in the world to which we could point in order to answer that question.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this advert, it\u2019s a grainy black-and-white montage supposedly showing life in \u201ca crime capital of the world\u201d (London). Apart from all the obviously disprovable fakery and dishonest manipulations and misrepresentations that we\u2019ll come to in a minute, the entire ad is inexplicably voiced by an actor doing a bad American accent. Why? He doesn\u2019t even go here. And yes \u2013 I get that on the one hand, this opens me up to the possibility of the actor who voiced the ad identifying himself and crossly declaring himself to be an actual American, perhaps hailing from one of the regions where they have unconvincing American accents.\nOn the other hand, this course of action would involve him identifying himself as the person who voiced this embarrassing ad, so \u2026 I\u2019m feeling relatively safe. Indeed, given I live in London I am feeling relatively safe anyway, what with the Crime Survey for England and Wales reporting that residents of the capital are less likely to be victims of crime than across the country as a whole.\nAnyway: the ad. Suffice to say that every creative decision taken on the script seems to have been signed off by a beta version of ChatGPT or someone who has suffered a recent head trauma. Sample writing: \u201cGripped by the tendrils of rising crime, London\u2019s citizens stay inside \u2026 the metropolis teetering on the brink of chaos.\u201d\n\u201cIn the depths of these narrow passageways,\u201d growls the unconvincing American, \u201ctread squads of Ulez enforcers, dressed in black, faces covered with masks, terrorising communities.\u201d Mm. But do they?\nOf similar concern is the decision to use a scare graph that, upon closer inspection, appears to resemble a graph showing crime in England and Wales significantly overtaking crime in London. But hey, it\u2019s a graph, it looks the part, it\u2019s got two lines crossing in a way that looks the right stripe of worrying.\nThe wider purpose of the ad is an attempt to cast London as a Gotham desperately in need of a Batman. Off the back of that statement, can I bring myself to type the words \u201cEnter Susan Hall\u201d? Yes I think I can, just for the mirthless laugh. Enter Susan Hall. If you\u2019re not familiar with Susan, she\u2019s the Conservative candidate running against Khan, and is arguably the final form in a long series of Tory mayoral hopefuls of whom the only question that can ever be asked is, \u201cOh wow \u2013 where on earth did they find that one?\u201d\nWhere DID they find Susan? Possibly on account of her lurid social media history, she\u2019s been described as a populist, and for much of her time since selection has come off as the best kind of populist \u2013 one who is not very popular. Having said that, the picture has distinctly shifted in recent months, and noises from the Labour campaign are increasingly strangulated. There is at least a small possibility that Hall could win \u2013 which would ironically be one of the most compelling arguments that London is having some form of existential crisis.\nNone of which is to suggest that Khan is the most exceptional of rivals. For my money he has been a very indifferent mayor, and anyone seeking a third term should be expected to be judged and attacked on their record. But the fact that he isn\u2019t, in ads like this, does matter. It does matter if parties fake scenes of terror in a London Underground station that turns out to be in New York. It does matter if untruths are told because it\u2019s easier than fighting truthfully. And \u2013 as discussed here previously \u2013 it matters when the other side do it too. It mattered when Keir Starmer decided to release an attack ad featuring a picture of a grinning Rishi Sunak and the slogan: \u201cDo you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nAll of these things matter and don\u2019t result in anything good. We already know where assaults on truth lead, because we\u2019ve seen them happen in other countries and in some cases our own, and people on all sides have spent a lot of the past decade lamenting it. The tragedy is that we all know it, and even the people who come up with the ads know it \u2013 but they\u2019re still doing it because they think that it works in the very short term. Yet in the long term, it really, really doesn\u2019t \u2013 which makes doing it anyway pretty criminal in itself.\nMarina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"

        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 08.00 CET",
        "content": "There is something unsettling about sitting in a German theatre laughing at Nazis. How unsettling depends on the type of humour that prompts the laughter. Is it meant to set the audience apart from the stage action, or does the laughter stem from the discomfort of proximity? When I saw the satire Nachtland staged recently at Berlin\u2019s prestigious Schaub\u00fchne (a production also runs in an English translation at the Young Vic in London until 20 April), I perceived the ripples of laughter filling the room as a sort of embarrassed self-awareness. Like a tense moment of getting caught \u2013 a feeling that every storyteller ultimately longs to evoke.\nIn the play, which has a present-day setting, two siblings find a painting signed by \u201cA. Hitler\u201d in their dead father\u2019s house. Once they realise that the kitschy artwork is worth more than \u20ac100,000 if they can credibly authenticate the artist as Hitler, the siblings start recasting their entire family history in a different light. While the previous narrative had insisted that \u201cour family had nothing to do with the Nazis\u201d (the dominant account in most German households), now suddenly the late grandmother is not only found to be a committed follower of Nazi ideology, but to have had a love affair with Hitler\u2019s secretary. As the new family history pragmatically, and profitably, unfolds, it becomes much more realistic, ironically, than the hitherto official version.\nSurveys have found that most Germans claim their family members did not actively support the Nazis. Ten percent say they don\u2019t know for sure, which could simply mean they never asked. Almost 30% even believe their ancestors were part of the resistance and helped potential victims of Nazi crimes survive or hid them in their own houses. Mathematically, the numbers don\u2019t add up \u2013 if they were accurate, millions of lives could have been saved. But psychologically, this self-perception gives deep insight into how collective remembrance of the Holocaust works for many Germans: There is guilt, but it is externalised. Nazis were always the others, the evil monsters from the History Channel; certainly not Grandpa Hans, who left a remarkable fortune he came into possession of during the early 1940s. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know\u201d is a common phrase you would hear from contemporary witnesses asked about the systematic annihilation of Jews, before this generation started to die.\nThis is the context in which to understand why Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film The Zone of Interest has received mixed reviews from German critics. The film has won international acclaim, honoured by two Oscars, one of them for best international feature film, as well as the Grand Prix in Cannes. But in Germany the film has not drawn universal approval. Glazer\u2019s focus on the idyllic family life of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss and his wife, Hedwig, in their home next to the concentration and extermination camp has been praised by some as the first feature movie to appropriately speak of the unspeakable horror of Auschwitz. Others, however, have said it represents a \u201ctrivialisation of the evil\u201d. The visual absence of camp inmates is especially controversial (we only hear them in the movie and watch the H\u00f6ss family ignoring the horrible sounds coming from the other side of the wall). It is either praised as a stringent examination of German repression, or slated as an \u201cannihilation of antisemitic violence\u201d.\nLeaving aside that provocative wording, it is true that Glazer\u2019s film shows antisemitic violence in just a few scenes, but that does not minimise it \u2013 rather, it underlines it even more effectively. The Nazi family knows what\u2019s going on next door; they approve of it; they are not even conflicted about it. Of course, this is a story about a privileged Nazi commandant who oversaw mass murder, and not your average German family living through the second world war. But in the naturalistic way the characters talk about daily banalities or care for their kids, their garden, their pets and their beautiful house \u2013 the way they don\u2019t have to care about anything outside \u2013 they could be seen to also represent the idealised, self-interested, bourgeois, even aspirational family today. Interestingly, the film doesn\u2019t bother to make the viewer identify with the Nazi family; the camera always observes them from a safe distance. The characters appear schematic, but not in the same way as the perpetrators from other Holocaust films. They resemble, rather, a normal, white, heteronormative German family.\nMight it be triggering to German audiences to watch such familiar domesticity intertwined so closely with the unimaginable crimes next door? Or that there is nothing to laugh or cry about in The Zone of Interest: no catharsis, no relief, just the constant unease of the diffuse horror in the background? The sounds from the camp and the technical conversations about the efficiency of the ovens instantly bring to mind images of Auschwitz. The film presupposes the audience knows about Auschwitz. At least in Germany, of all places, this is an assumption that can be made because of the country\u2019s \u201cremembrance culture\u201d.\nThis Erinnerungskultur, or commitment to face up to the nation\u2019s crimes under nazism, is, according to the social scientist Samuel Salzborn, mainly characterised by official commemoration and private denial, a deep gap between the domestic and the public sphere. The Jewish-German writer Max Czollek describes German memory culture as an effort \u201cto reconcile the Germans with themselves\u201d.\nBut there is no room for reconciliation in The Zone of Interest. While German film productions on the Third Reich made in recent decades tend to stress the potential for acts of resistance even among higher ranking circles of the Wehrmacht, Glazer\u2019s film allows resistance only in the shape of a lonely Polish girl hiding apples in bushes for Auschwitz inmates. It concentrates on looking at the perpetrator. Not with disgust, not with compassion: it just looks. This film is a depiction of guilt. And that, perhaps, is, above all, why it sits uneasily with German audiences. The guilt we see can\u2019t be externalised or historicised: it is ubiquitous and ageless. Its germ cell lies in the aspirations and wealth of the nuclear family; in the pragmatism and self-righteousness that give rise to their complicity in genocide. That the film has divided opinion in Germany only proves how powerful this approach really is.\nFatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based Guardian Europe columnist\nSign up to This is Europe\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment\nafter newsletter promotion\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Peter Apps",
        "teaser": "If it gets to No 10, the party should fund a social housing boom, tackle homelessness \u2013 and usher in a post-Grenfell era of safety",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 13.00 CET",
        "content": "The failures in housing policy over several generations are now all too obvious: rising homelessness, families and key workers priced out of cities and a generation unable to move out of their parents\u2019 homes. The next government needs to take radical action to change this picture, rather than make small tweaks to a failed system. These are some of the steps I would take to get there.\nThe next Labour government must break with the idea that we can no longer afford to build new social rented homes, and instead return to the ideals of the postwar consensus, where housing provision was as much a role for the state as health and education.\nDespite towering war debts, in 1953 the UK\u2019s local authorities built 245,000 social rented homes in a single year, which accounted for 75% of all homes built. Last year, there were a shade over 9,500 social rent homes built in England \u2013 just 4% of all homes built.\nWe are not going to go back to 1950s levels of council housebuilding any time soon, but the contrasting figures should at least illustrate that another way is possible. Even a return to the 40,000 social rented homes built in 2010-11 \u2013 a result of New Labour programmes \u2013 or the 57,000 built under a Conservative government in 1993 would make a major difference. The low numbers in recent years are a historical quirk of the post-2010 austerity era, and Labour should consign them to history.\nThe party should realise that higher levels of investment in social housing are necessary to make its big commitment to new towns work and to navigate the current market downturn. Since there is no point turning on the taps with the plug out, Labour should also scrap the right to buy as part of this drive.\nA report last month calculated that investing in 90,000 social homes would repay within 11 years and would generate a \u00a312bn profit for the taxpayer over 30 years. It is time to understand that government borrowing for this sort of investment is wholly different from borrowing for tax cuts, energy bill relief or banking sector bailouts. If rigid fiscal rules preclude this sort of investment, the rules should change.\nOver the past 14 years, the government\u2019s stated housing objective has been to boost home ownership. The result? A steep rise in house prices.\nMeanwhile, the number of households in temporary accommodation in England has soared to 109,000 \u2013 a rise of almost 120% since 2010. On top of this, rough sleeping has risen by 27% in a year, and the number of families presenting to their council as homeless has grown by almost 30,000 in five years.\nLabour should change the state\u2019s housing policy objective from boosting home ownership to relieving and preventing homelessness \u2013 the most obvious and tragic manifestation of our broken system.\nBy promising to be judged on its ability to reduce rough sleeping, the number of families in temporary accommodation and individuals who present to their local authority as homeless, Labour would mark a vital philosophical shift from which better policy would flow.\nThe quickest lever would be to increase the local housing allowance \u2013 the total benefits that can be claimed for housing costs \u2013 back to pre-austerity levels. This would allow councils to rehouse homeless families more easily and allow those in financial stress to keep a roof over their head.\nBut in the longer term, Labour would need to explore western European private rental models, the defining characteristics of which are some form of rent control and long-term security of tenure. It would also mean adopting housing-first models, where rough sleepers are given a home along with further support, which have all but eliminated rough sleeping in Finland.\nThe shocking scenes in Valencia last month, where 10 people died in a tower fire, are the most stark reminder of the urgent need to make our buildings safe. Nearly seven years on from the Grenfell Tower fire, there are still many thousands of buildings around the UK that have major fire safety defects. The residents of these buildings are unable to move on with their lives and it is only luck that has prevented a repeat disaster.\nWhat should have happened in the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell fire, and what Labour must prioritise in government, is a centralised response from the recently created building safety regulator. The next government should beef up its powers, give it a mandate to oversee the removal of dangerous cladding and repair of other defects and ensure that developers, contractors and cladding suppliers are held to account. Tough action should be taken against those dragging their feet.\nFire safety should simply be the first step in a major push to raise safety and quality standards across the whole housing sector, which must also include stronger rights for renters living in disrepair. We also need tougher oversight of construction sites, strong penalties for those who fail to build safe homes and genuine protections for homebuyers. Otherwise the planned expansion of housebuilding will simply be an expansion of the building safety crisis.\nPeter Apps is the author of Show Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell Happen"

        "author": "Keith Gildart",
        "teaser": "UK industrial towns offered not only well-paid jobs, but a whole culture. A radical alternative is desperately needed",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 14.37 CET",
        "content": "Last week, Tata Steel in Port Talbot announced the immediate closure of its coke ovens. These ovens create the coke that ultimately powers the blast furnaces, which, as was announced in January, are due to be shut down. The decision by Tata to close the furnaces sent shock waves through the community. There are set to be 2,800 job losses \u2013 a huge blow for a small town that has already undergone significant cuts to its steel industry over the past decades. A final chapter in the decades-long deindustrialisation of the British economy appears to be coming to a close.\nPlant closures are never only about the loss of work, but also the cultural and psychological effects on the people who are made unemployed, on families and communities. Steel provided well-paid, unionised and skilled employment, and created a working-class culture that gave the country Labour MPs, athletes, musicians, writers, artists and a sense of community and collective purpose. Port Talbot even gave the world the cinematic presence of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins.\nSuch a distinct, collectivist culture was crucial to the development of Wales, central Scotland and parts of England in the 19th and 20th centuries. At its peak in the 1960s, Port Talbot steelworks employed about 18,000 workers, complemented by the nearly 60,000 employed in south Wales coalmines. These industries after the second world war offered an alternative vision of industrial relations, investment, community development, and a Wales (and Britain) with working-class agency at its centre.\nThe seeds of the destruction of this world of labour were planted with the mass closures of coalmines in the late 1950s and then the 1960s, with patchy attempts by governments to mitigate the effects. But the election of a Labour government in 1974 granted a temporary reprieve to the steel and coal industries. The subsequent Plan for Coal envisaged a long-term future for the industry with the introduction of new technology, skills and high wages. In these years, a miner could become an engineer, a mine manager, an official of the National Coal Board, a trade union official or a Labour MP. Others could take advantage of the education provided by the National Union of Mineworkers and enter university. Having started work as a coalminer in 1985, I took this path in 1992, studying history and politics and eventually became a university professor. Yet with the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, a darkness descended over the steel and coal communities.\nThe warning shot for British Steel and Welsh industry came with the closure of Shotton in March 1980, when 6,500 jobs were axed in a single day. The steel strike of the same year ended in defeat for the steelworkers. By the time Ian MacGregor left his role at British Steel in 1983 to move on to the National Coal Board, he had cut the steel workforce by almost 60% in only three years. After the crushing defeat of the miners in their year-long fight against closures in 1984-85, pits rapidly disappeared from the British landscape. The destruction of communities quickly followed. Both the moderate leadership of the steel unions and the more militant activism of the miners could do nothing to stem the tide of unemployment, inequality, poverty and the transformation of the world of work.\nWhat has the loss of this world ushered in? The impact can be seen not just in Port Talbot but across the post-industrial regions of Wales, England and Scotland. While that industrial world of work brought with it risks to life and health, the income, opportunities and relative security offered stability. That has been replaced by warehousing, logistics, retail parks that offer zero-hours contracts, low wages, no long-term security and hostility to trade union membership and representation. Decades after the closures, Britain\u2019s coalfields are still feeling the long-term effects, suffering disproportionately from multiple inequalities.\nThe deindustrialisation of Britain and the marginalisation of the working class has also had a profound impact on political engagement and representation. Your Labour MP is now likely to be a lawyer, special adviser and expensively educated graduate, rather than a steelworker or a coalminer. Meanwhile, the organised working class has moved further to the periphery of political and civic British life. At the same time, perhaps counterintuitively, the old industrial workforce is viewed with a sense of deference rather than suspicion. Steelworkers and coalminers have gone from being labelled as industrial dinosaurs, technological Luddites and enemies within, to being almost canonised through films such as The Full Monty and Billy Elliot.\nThat is all very well and good, but what is really needed is an appreciation of the communities and the political alternatives that they provided. Post-steel and post-coal localities need a radical industrial policy that would bring high-paid jobs, skills and opportunities that could form the basis of a real driver of levelling up. As the Port Talbot coke ovens close, what is the government doing to fill the void?\nKeith Gildart is a former coalminer, and now a professor of labour and social history at the University of Wolverhampton"

        "headline": "Synthetic opiods have arrived in Britain. As a former drug dealer, I know how the UK should respond",
        "author": "Niko Vorobyov",
        "teaser": "There are better ways of tackling addiction and overdoses than reverting to the tactics of a failed drugs war",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 16.24 CET",
        "content": "Last week the home secretary, James Cleverly, announced that nitazenes are now being treated as class A drugs, his statement bookended with the usual stern rhetoric about the need to keep \u201cthese vile drugs off our streets\u201d. The maximum penalty for selling or supplying class As is life imprisonment.\nCleverly\u2019s decision follows the discovery that several victims of deadly drug poisonings had nitazenes in their system. Nitazenes are synthetic opioids, meaning they are similar to the heroin and morphine refined from opium poppies but made entirely in a lab. First developed as painkillers in the 1950s but never approved for medical use, they have been found mixed into heroin to give the low-grade variety of the drug that extra kick, as well as in bootleg Xanax and Valium pills sold on the dark web. Up to 500 times stronger than morphine, even a tiny amount can prove fatal.\nIn these relatively few instances, there are echoes of the US\u2019s overdose epidemic, which now claimsmore than 100,000 lives a year \u2013 more than half of which are from fentanyl, another synthetic opioid. This outbreak has sparked a revival of tough-on-drugs policies. But if the UK risks sliding towards an opioid crisis, these are the pitfalls we must avoid.\nA month ago, the state of Oregon repealed its Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act (known as Measure 110), which had passed by referendum in 2020, decriminalising personal quantities of narcotics as part of a \u201chealth-based\u201d based approach to drug addiction. Under that law, users weren\u2019t arrested for holding a gram of cocaine, but instead were fined $100 unless they entered into drug treatment services. Dealing, meanwhile, was still classified as a crime. But amid a spiralling death toll from the fentanyl crisis, and homeless people\u2019s tents filling the sidewalks, lawmakers panicked and reversed their decision. Drug users caught with small quantities of drugs may now face prison again.\nThis reversion to the drug-war norm makes little sense \u2013 it has been proved time and time again that greater criminalisation does nothing to lower addiction rates. Politicians lost their nerve in Oregon because of a rise in drug fatalities after Measure 110 was passed \u2013 but as one study showed, this is more to do with the growing prevalence of fentanyl than users taking greater risks because of looser penalties. It is a fact that wherever fentanyl hits the market in the US, the death rate shoots up. Police action disrupting the supply chain only makes matters worse, as new dealers appear with unknown strength and quality. A recent study in Indiana found that fatal overdoses spiked each time there was a major drug bust.\nA growing street homelessness problem \u2013 and the very public drug-taking that many of those on the streets are embroiled in \u2013 also forced the hand of lawmakers. But people don\u2019t pitch up a tent under a bypass because of addiction issues. West Virginia has been among the worst-hit by drug deaths, but boasts the lowest homelessness rate. Why? Housing there is relatively cheap, while average rents in Oregon doubled between 2020 and 2021. Could it be that unaffordable rents are pushing people from their homes? No, it must be the drugs!\nSnapping on the handcuffs doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve tried tramadol, drunk lean (a cocktail of codeine plus soda) and smoked opium, and I get why folks grow addicted to opioids. If your life feels empty and hopeless, why not? They don\u2019t fill the void, but they let you not care. They\u2019re like an anaesthetic for inner pain. One recent study found that 96% of patients leaving mandatory detox relapsed within months, proving that caging people does not cure them of their trauma. You simply can\u2019t force someone into sobriety.\nWhat could Britain do differently? In the 1980s, a Liverpool clinic headed by Welsh doctor John Marks provided free heroin and cocaine courtesy of the NHS. There was no toxic fentanyl or nitazenes, no one dropped dead from an overdose, and the stability of a steady fix gave their patients a chance to live normal lives, holding down jobs and rebuilding bonds with their families without being on edge for policemen or pushers. Their business drying up, heroin dealers began disappearing from the area.\nSo why should law-abiding taxpayers foot the bill for these junkies getting their jollies? Well for a start, it\u2019s more cost-efficient. The cohort of patients at a similar clinic in Middlesborough committed 541 crimes prior to entering the programme, costing \u00a32.1m in taxpayer money. And if they were locked away in prison, it cost another \u00a347,000 a year to keep them housed and fed, again at taxpayers\u2019 expense. Giving them free heroin, on the other hand, costs only \u00a312,000 per year, while giving them a chance to get their life back together. Over a period of six months, the Middlesborough cohort committed a grand total of three crimes, all had found a roof over their heads (many were previously unhoused), and they had stopped buying smack from their dealers (which may have contained toxic additives) almost entirely. That is, until funding was cut in 2022.\nFeeding their dependency wasn\u2019t an ideal solution, but since long-term diamorphine use \u2013 ie clinically pure heroin \u2013 causes minimal damage to the body, certainly less than alcohol, it avoids the absolute worst consequences. You can\u2019t help someone if they\u2019re dead.\nWith the Taliban\u2019s poppy ban cutting off the heroin supply from Afghanistan, it\u2019s likely that synthetic opioids will become more common on Britain\u2019s illicit narcotics scene, regardless of whether they\u2019re class A, B or Z. To get ahead of the game, safe supply is the only logical solution.\n Niko Vorobyov is a Russian-British freelance journalist, convicted drug peddler and author of Dopeworld"

        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 13.09 CET",
        "content": "Do clubs matter? Yes, to their members, and clearly to those they exclude. When Alexis de Tocqueville compared American democracy with British, he said America\u2019s roots were in the mob and Britain\u2019s in the club. Americans vote for a president who doesn\u2019t sit in Congress. Britons vote for a member of parliament, a tight-knit Westminster club.\nThe revived argument over London\u2019s Garrick Club would have been music to De Tocqueville\u2019s ears. Here we go again, a gang of London elitists ruling the land from a Covent Garden palace untainted by plebs or women. And this in the 21st century. Give us a break.\nPlaces where those of like mind can meet and enjoy each other\u2019s company are valuable. They enrich leisure and guard against loneliness. As guilds, lodges and associations, they exist in every community \u2013 including some for men and women separately. London\u2019s clubs are a case in point. The Garrick, where I am a member, is not some fiendish hotbed of influence. Its average age is about 70 and those who frequent it are overwhelmingly retired. In my view, it cannot be regarded as a significant centre of power, but rather a good place to eat and entertain. It is popular and certainly livelier than traditional clubland haunts.\nThe Garrick was named after the actor David Garrick, as the club for London\u2019s theatrical and arts community. Its \u201caffinity\u201d was no different from the military clubs\u2019 exclusion of certain classes of soldier or the university clubs\u2019 restriction to Oxbridge. All originally excluded women. Many clubs such as Brooks\u2019s, Boodle\u2019s, the Travellers and the Savile continue this exclusion of women, or exclusion of men in the case of the University Women\u2019s. The Savile kept its cool in 2017 when it allowed a member to stay after they transitioned to become a woman. Margaret Thatcher was made a member of the men-only Carlton Club in 1975, largely because no one dared exclude her.\nWhat makes the Garrick different \u2013 and has attracted media attention \u2013 is that some of its members are prominent in public affairs, including, apparently, the king. He is not known to have used the club. Membership seems to confer networking power beyond its walls. In particular, the Garrick has long been favoured by senior lawyers, with a profusion of senior judges. The judiciary is a largely self-governing profession and many lawyers \u2013 not only women \u2013 have come to regard membership as divisive and potentially a kind of freemasonry. Earlier this week a number of judges were pressed into resigning. It is within the legal world these concerns are concentrated. I really do not think such a charge could be directed at other professions at the club. It is merely absurd, not career-damaging, that Stephen Fry can belong to the Garrick, but not Judi Dench.\nIn truth, the Garrick\u2019s problem over women attracts publicity because, unlike the other all-male clubs, it contains a large number of progressive members who want women in and who have been fighting for it for years. In the last two votes on women, in 2015 and last autumn, a clear majority was in favour, but the rules stated that two-thirds was required to carry. Legal opinion has since been sought, and it is plain that there is no actual rule opposing female members. There is therefore no rule that has to be changed. The membership committee can simply allow women to join.\nI feel strongly that any association of citizens in a free society should be allowed to hold its own opinions and make its own rules, from political parties to London clubs. But for me, the exclusion of women from havens of civilised conversation and debate is the opposite of liberal. It is out of date and wrong.\nIn the case of the Garrick, this is not a purely private matter. The club has become a symbolic institution on London\u2019s cultural scene, its exclusivity a practice that should long ago have ended. The majority of its members clearly want that discrimination to end. I sense it is about to happen. I look forward to celebrating it.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

        "content": "For Julian Assange, the wait continues. The pause can be counted as a small victory in the long battle to fight his extradition to the United States. But it is one of the many shameful issues in this most shameful of sagas that his waiting room is a cell in a high security prison where he has been held for the past five years, despite having been convicted of nothing.\nThe high court decision issued by Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Johnson means that the US has been given a short time to offer \u201cassurances\u201d as to how his trial would be conducted and that the death penalty would not be imposed. Astonishingly it has previously been unable to provide them. Assange\u2019s defence team will then be allowed to challenge those \u201cassurances\u201d issued by a country with a long record of ignoring many of the basic rights of anyone deemed to be threatening the security of the state in any way.\nIt is almost exactly a year since the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia on espionage charges. He will face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. There have been negotiations between the two governments over the possibility of a prisoner swap. Both of his parents attended Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address this month, at which the president said that the administration was \u201cworking around the clock to bring home Evan\u201d. His father, Mikhail Gershkovich, said the address was a sign that \u201ceverybody in the US government \u2013 the Senate and Congress and the White House \u2013 are taking the freedom of the press seriously, and that\u2019s important\u201d.\nIt is important, but it is also hypocritical of the US to plead for Gershkovich\u2019s release after he has spent a year in jail, while seeking to extradite and lock up Assange and simultaneously boast about a commitment to freedom of the press.\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US was considering a plea deal offer that would allow Assange to admit to a misdemeanour rather than the more serious charges he now faces under the Espionage Act. Supposedly, if he pleaded guilty to the lesser charges of mishandling classified documents, he would be allowed to enter a plea remotely from London and would be freed shortly afterwards on the basis that he had already served five years in custody. But Assange\u2019s lawyers have not yet heard anything of such a deal.\nThe next three weeks will show us whether real discussions are taking place in Washington about freedom of the press, or whether they still imagine that hoisting Assange to jail is worth the ridicule of the world. When it emerged earlier this year that the US had been trying to persuade British and American journalists who had had differences of opinion with Assange to give evidence against him, it became clear just how weak and grotesque its case was against him.\n\u201cThis legally unprecedented prosecution seeks to criminalise the application of ordinary journalistic practices of obtaining and publishing true classified information of the most obvious and important public interest,\u201d was how Edward Fitzgerald KC put the case for Assange at last month\u2019s hearing. The battle against that prosecution continues, and only the unconditional release of Assange will demonstrate that both the UK and the US regard \u201cfreedom of the press\u201d as something to be honoured \u2013 rather than merely a phrase of sanctimonious waffle.\nDuncan Campbell is a freelance writer who worked for the Guardian as crime correspondent and Los Angeles correspondent\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Ella Sinclair",
        "teaser": "The mooted memorial to the navy\u2019s West Africa Squadron seems to be an attempt to rewrite history in a more favourable light",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 15.25 CET",
        "content": "Until very recently, most people in Britain would have said that this country\u2019s most significant involvement in the transatlantic slave trade was our heroic decision to abolish it. In the past few years, this culturally ingrained consensus has been challenged by a renewed attention to Britain\u2019s long-lasting legacy of slavery \u2013 and to the many families and institutions that profited from the enslavement of Africans. In the ongoing struggle to determine the meaning of this history, individuals and institutions across Britain\u2019s political spectrum are grappling with the same pivotal question: how do we remember our past?\nFor the campaigners seeking to build a new monument in Portsmouth commemorating Britain\u2019s West Africa Squadron \u2013 the Royal Navy unit tasked with intercepting slave ships after Britain outlawed the trade in 1807 \u2013 the answer is simple.\nColin Kemp, the retired businessman who is raising \u00a370,000 to put up a statue of a naval officer freeing an enslaved African, launched his campaign in the Daily Mail with the frank declaration: \u201cI think we have got very little to apologise for.\u201d\nPenny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, is among the many Tory peers and MPs loudly backing the memorial, which has also received a \u00a325,000 donation from the party\u2019s former deputy chair Michael Ashcroft. \u201cYes, Britain had a role in the slave trade,\u201d Mordaunt wrote in the Daily Mail. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear about something else too. We ended it. Our biggest contribution to the evil trade was to end it.\u201d\nThe statue\u2019s backers see their campaign as a correction to what Mordaunt calls \u201canti-British, grievance-based\u201d attempts to \u201crewrite our history in the bleakest way\u201d. But their own account of the squadron\u2019s history is a rose-tinted one, which neglects historical facts and erases space for a more nuanced memory of Britain\u2019s past.\nThe campaign\u2019s fundraising website claims, incorrectly, that \u201cBritain was the first country to ban slavery, we used our own ships, men and money to enforce this ban\u201d. (Denmark was the first European country to ban the slave trade, in 1803, and Haiti was established as the world\u2019s first free Black republic in 1804.) Echoing the campaigners, Mordaunt claims that the West Africa Squadron, which was active until the 1860s, was \u201cthe main actor in physically destroying the slave trade\u201d, but this is a dramatic overstatement: though the squadron is credited with capturing 1,600 ships and freeing 150,000 enslaved Africans, more than 3 million people were trafficked across the Atlantic while it was active.\nAccording to the campaign, the statue will depict three key parts of the story of the West Africa Squadron: \u201cthe evil of slavery, the bravery of the sailors and the new life for the freed Africans\u201d.\nBritain banned the slave trade in 1807, after almost 20 years of parliamentary debate on the matter. It took another quarter-century for Britain to abolish slavery across the empire, and another five years after that for the full emancipation of the enslaved.\nThe West Africa Squadron was deployed from 1808 with the task of stopping British slave-trading ships, but this initial enforcement took on a more humanitarian bent as the squadron began to target the ships of other countries as well. The campaign for a monument is correct that significant resources were committed to this mission: over a period of 60 years, the Royal Navy spent millions of pounds on the squadron, and 1,600 sailors lost their lives. But even this was hugely insufficient: the ships were old, slow and too few in number, and the unit is estimated to have intercepted fewer than 10% of the ships involved in the slave trade.\nMore significantly, \u201cthe new life for the freed Africans\u201d rescued by the squadron was hardly free. The estimated 150,000 men, women and children whose ships were captured suffered continued exploitation and degradation at the hands of the British.\nAfter intercepting slave ships bound for the Americas, the West Africa Squadron sailed the formerly enslaved human cargo to British colonies; namely, Sierra Leone and Saint Helena. Once docked, captured Africans were made to remain onboard ships for long periods (sometimes months) in squalid conditions while lengthy British bureaucracy ensued: this led to high rates of unnecessary deaths and disease.\nOnce allowed off the ships, the \u201cliberated Africans\u201d \u2013 as they were known at the time \u2013 were not repatriated to their home countries; they were instead subject to forced hard labour under poor conditions, reminiscent of the slavery they narrowly escaped. Military conscription was the fate of \u201cliberated\u201d men; \u201cliberated\u201d children were subject to apprenticeship, where they worked for a master with no wage for a number of years. In Sierra Leone, there are reports of unmarried \u201cliberated\u201d women being forced into marriage.\nThe legitimate effort to remember the history of the West Africa Squadron should not require the repetition of falsehoods, like the myth of the \u201cliberated Africans\u201d or the misconception that the Royal Navy \u201cended slavery\u201d.\nEmancipation was not simply given to the enslaved by benevolent sailors. It was fought for. This history deserves commemoration just as much as the advocacy of William Wilberforce and the work of the squadron. Britain\u2019s decision to finally abolish slavery in 1833 was itself influenced by the 1831-32 slave revolt in Jamaica, also known as the Christmas rebellion, which helped shock parliament into acting.\nOne year ago, in a powerful essay for the Guardian\u2019s Cotton Capital project, Gary Younge addressed our nation\u2019s ability to \u201cforget\u201d the gritty realities of our slaving past. Far from an innocent moment of amnesia, this \u201cforgetting\u201d is a destructive task, and a \u201cprivilege of the powerful\u201d.\nWhat we choose to remember of Britain\u2019s legacy of slavery does not seem to require adherence to historical fact, but refers instead to some axiomatic, felt understanding about who we are as a nation. And so the pursuit of historical truth becomes an \u201canti-British\u201d blasphemy, seen as an attempt to vandalise the myth that Britain\u2019s only relationship to slavery was to abolish it.\nAcknowledging the complicated history of the West Africa Squadron is not an unpatriotic lament; it is part of establishing a healthier relationship with the complexities of our past, based on a sturdier and more honest foundation. Britain\u2019s history of abolition can still be a proud one \u2013 as long as it is not built on mistruths.\nElla Sinclair is a freelance writer who covers race, history, politics and social justice\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "author": "Owen Jones",
        "teaser": "The policy has its critics, but as Tories and Labour vow to keep it, I back its retention. It can be made fair, and a state should care for its people",
        "published": "Wed 27 Mar 2024 07.00 CET",
        "content": "A wealthy nation can afford to offer a comfortable and secure existence for all of its citizens. If it chooses not to do so, that is a political choice. If rationality reigned supreme, this would prove the starting point for all decisions about how society is organised. Bad news: it doesn\u2019t, and instead much of the vast riches generated by the graft of millions of workers ends up hoovered into the bank accounts \u2013 and offshore tax havens \u2013 of a tiny few. The result? It\u2019s easy to encourage the general population to believe that they\u2019re locked in trench warfare over ever-scarcer resources, with so little to go around that politics is merely the art of managing a zero-sum game.\nEnter, then, the question of the triple lock on the state pension, which both Tories and Labour have confirmed will feature in their upcoming manifestos. First introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010, it ensures that pensioners\u2019 entitlements increase each April in line with whatever is highest: inflation, the average increase in wages, or a 2.5% minimum. That means more than \u00a3100bn is now splashed on the state pension each year, by far the biggest single item of social security spending, while working-age benefits have fallen drastically behind. When you include other entitlements, well over half of the welfare state ends up in pensioners\u2019 bank accounts. At the same time, more than 60% of older Britons own their home outright, sitting on golden eggs that have only appreciated in value.\nYou can see why Britain has become a petri dish of generational resentment. Since the dawn of the triple lock, our working-age population has suffered the most protracted squeeze in living standards since records began. Younger Britons, in particular, have been devastated by a social tsunami: real-terms cuts to their education, stagnating pay packets, student debts, collapsing homeownership, a rip-off private rented sector, a devastated welfare state \u2013 well, we truly could go on.\nThe resentment only deepens. While older Britons have been gifted with the protections of social democracy, they have consistently voted for their grandchildren to be blasted with the icy chills of \u201csink or swim\u201d capitalism. It is not widely appreciated that, when Labour suffered its 2019 electoral cataclysm, it actually won more votes from the working-age population than the Tories; 57% of Britons in their 60s voted Tory in 2019, for those in their 70s, that figure rose to a staggering 67%. Younger citizens largely saw Brexit as an attack on their futures, a rupture only made possible thanks to grey voters, while much of the so-called culture wars boils down to a backlash among older Britons against the increasingly progressive values of millennials and generation Z.\nBut believing that the woes of the young can be solved by diminishing provision for the old is a grave mistake. More than 2 million pensioners languish beneath the poverty line \u2013 an increase in relative poverty rates compared with a decade ago. In a list comparing incomes against the cost of living in 30 European nations, the British state pension appears at a mediocre number 16. Britain is the sixth-largest economy on Earth, yet even now remains incapable of offering a basic contract: that every Briton should be assured comfort and security in their final years.\nThose who advocate a less generous state pension are unintentionally attacking the young. After all, we are all aspirational pensioners. If our state pension increases at a lesser rate, where will that leave today\u2019s 25-year-old, whenever they\u2019re able to retire? After all, siren voices already advocate hiking it to 71. It is the working class, as ever, who will be punished. On average, the less well-off not only have shorter lifespans than the affluent: they tend to suffer ill health sooner, robbing them of comfortable retirements. They are less likely, of course, to have assets and means to supplement the state pension. Those robbed of security in earlier years will suffer the same fate later on, especially if they have less.\nThere is a predictable retort: what of the 3 million pensioners with household wealth valued at over \u00a31m? Why do they need state pensions at all? This inevitably always takes the conversation to the question of means testing, which is not only expensive and bureaucratic, but leaves many vulnerable citizens failing to claim support they need. As it is, more than a third of families eligible for the means-tested pension credit, for example, do not claim it.\nThe answer here is obvious. The dividing line that really matters is who has wealth, and who does not. Generous universal entitlements are the only proven means of ensuring that all who need support receive it. You can then simply recoup revenue from wealthy pensioners through taxation. Indeed, a detailed study by the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 \u2013 which brought together academics and tax specialists \u2013 found that a one-off wealth tax on millionaire couples paid at 1% a year for half a decade would raise \u00a3260bn. Much of that would come from prosperous pensioners, of course, but also from Britons of any age of substantial means. This vast sum could lift the living standards of all struggling Britons, irrespective of age.\nAnd that\u2019s what matters. Politicians of all parties have left us believing that there simply aren\u2019t the resources to solve our problems. That reduces society to a cauldron of often dangerous resentments, variously encouraging many to believe that our lives would be better if the undeserving would stop hogging meagre services and entitlements: often, the demonised foreigner, or supposedly feckless fellow Brits.\nFor many younger citizens, their worldviews understandably defined by their chronic economic insecurity and inclusive social values, there lurks the spectre of the bigoted, entitled, selfish boomer, whose dreadful electoral choices have robbed them of their futures. It\u2019s an understandably seductive narrative, but offers false solutions that will only hurt them more.\nThis is a rich nation. It suits those with booming fortunes to pretend otherwise, because it would lead to demands that they stop appropriating the nation\u2019s wealth. It suits them well when we squabble among ourselves.\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist"
